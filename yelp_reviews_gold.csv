"Rosie, Dakota, and I LOVE Chaparral Dog Park!!! It's very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths, a desert xeriscape, baseball fields, ballparks, and a lake with ducks.

The Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept. does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded.  You can find trash cans and poopy-pick up mitts located all over the park and paths.

The fenced in area is huge to let the dogs run, play, and sniff!",high
"I met a friend for lunch yesterday. 

Loved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. 

Inside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of ""Dusk Till Dawn"". 

We were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? 
We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. 

Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) 
There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.

For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. 
There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good. 

My Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.

I'll give 3 stars until I go back and try out some other things.",high
"I love this place! I have been coming here for ages.
My favorites: Elsa's Chicken sandwich, any of their burgers, dragon chicken wings, china's little chicken sandwich, and the hot pepper chicken sandwich. The atmosphere is always fun and the art they display is very abstract but totally cool!",high
"Came here for breakfast yesterday, it had been years since I have stopped in here and do not remember the entire place having waiter service.  Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha.",high
"This Place just opened up next to the salon I work in. AMAZING! They hit the ground running, 

It's a deli style, where you order at the counter and they bring you the food. I had the Grayhawk Turkey Club and the turkey was great! No packaged crap here. It was thick sliced and probably rotisserie. For the side I had sweet potato tater tots. DELISH! The have regular fries, sweet fries, tater tots, onion rings, etc. 

Great looking salads, Chicago-style dogs, gourmet burgers and yummy sounding mac and cheese. 

The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price. It's great for dinner, but a little steep for a work day lunch.",low
"After my last review, somewhat scathing regarding the burgers, I got an invite from the management to come down, meet the chef and give him another try.  I thought to myself, ""how nice"", they read my review and they are concerned about the quality of their product.  I think that is admirable.  I did not take them up on the offer, because I don't feel that would be appropriate - I'm interested in doing yelp reviews because I have benefitted from reading the reviews of others, and I want to share my thoughts and feelings too :-) - I'm not looking for freebies.

So, anyway, last friday seemed like a good day to walk over to LGO and see what's shakin.  I grabbed my growler jug (still the best deal around) and the wife, called a friend to join us for a beer and walked on down to the corner.  The evening was a bit on the warm side, but it was quiet and about the normal buzz of busyness for this corner.  It's always kinda crazy and we like to sit on the patio to watch the manic drivers race around trying to find parking.  We went into the store and the wife ordered a grilled-fish sandwich.  I nervously ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  After placing our orders and getting warned that we needed to be around to pick them up, I moseyed over to the bar to get my jug filled with Stella.  Did I mention that this is an awesome deal?  So, we got some glasses and headed out to the patio.  Soon afterward, they called our name and we got our grub.  My wife's fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh's and ahhhhs', and she raved about the perfect texture, grilled flavor and delicious, fresh multi-grain bread.  She also raved about the slaw that came with it.  I think she liked this sandwich.  The burger, on the other hand, is still a disappointment.  I ordered it Medium Rare (the only way to order a burger) and kudos to the woman for not warning me about undercooked meats - I'm aware.  really. And I asked for cheese and put it on a hamburger bun.  It came open-faced with a pile of coarsly shredded mild cheddar cheese.  It had the appropriate veggies - lettuce, pickle and tomato, red onion slices and the special sauce.  With a pile of limp matchstick fries on the side, it was a big pile-o-food.  The portion was impressive.  That's about where it ended for me.  The burger was overcooked and the pile of shredded cheese is a bit off-putting.  It's impressive, I'll give 'em that, but a big pile of cold, shredded cheese just doesn't work for me.  The cheese needs to be melted.  A good burger has the cheese melted.  at least some.  Lot's of cheese can be fun, but it overpowers the rest of the flavors and tends to cool the burger quickly.  I scraped off about two-thirds of the cheese - enough to make a cheese crisp if I had a tortilla, and put the burger together.  Flavor was so-so.  After I added some salt and pepper, flavor was just a little better than so-so.  Burger was cooked to med-well, but still juicy.  The veggies were fresh and crispy.  A side of mayo for dipping the fries in is required for me.  I like my fries Belgian style.  The bun was a little dry and on the edge of stale, but not bad enough that I could not eat it still.  Overall, I stand by my original review of the burgers here.  I realize LGO is trying to stand out with a ""different"" presentation, and I applaud the effort, but I think it needs a bit more work to stand out at a time when everybody is doing burgers.  The fries were sub-par, limp and forgettable.  The ambiance, however, is what brings us back.  Sitting on the corner patio, sipping a beer, having a great conversation and watching the show all around me is a great way to wind down on a warm Friday night.  LGO - keep working on the burger, I'll keep coming in, but I think I'll stick with the wings for now.",high

"The vibe exuding from this place is pure awesomeness. Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant. 

I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.


So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:

*Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.

*Spicy Buffalo ""Wings"": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the ""wings"". This dish is a must try!!

*Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.

*Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!

Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.


Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving ""meat"" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.  

Might I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date.",low
"Rokerij is worth the hype. We popped in last week for a late bite and left super happy. We scored a few seats at the bar, the place was SUPER crowded (which is a good sign on a Wednesday). I started with a beer called Banana Bread, which was awesome. Wifey had a glass of wine, but I can't remember what it was. We couldn't decide on what we wnated so we ended up splitting the entree of Blackened Salmon with Apple/Chipotle chutney and some potatoes. We also got three of the small Plates: mini reuben, crispy calamari and cilantro rubbed grilled shrimp. All the food was awesome. The salmon was cooked perfectly, although i think I would have liked the chutney on the side, but that's small fries. The calamari was cooked perfectly, the shrimp were awesome (although the bed of rice it came on was meh), and the mini reubens were great as well. I was super excited to try it, and it delivered. Can't wait to go back!",low
"Great hotel in Central Phoenix for a stay-cation, but not necessarily a place to stay out of town and without a car. Not much around the area, and unless you're familiar with downtown, I would rather have a guest stay in Old Town Scottsdale, etc. BUT if you do stay here, it's awesome. Great boutique rooms. Awesome pool that's happening in the summer. A GREAT rooftop patio bar, and a very very busy lobby with Gallo Blanco attached. A great place to stay, but have a car!",high
"I was only able to play the front 9; my wrist was hurting too much to finish, which is a big deal because I live in IL, and was returning from LA and stopped here specifically to play the TPC. Oh well.

I was a single, and got paired with another. The course was pretty open, but we took our time and enjoyed the round. The front nine, although rarely shown on TV, is quite nice. Definitely challenging enough, and I didn't even play the back tees.

It was fairly easy to get on, the bar had pretty good food for a clubhouse, and the staff were very helpful. Definitely recommend the TPC.",high
"Love this place. Actually, today was awesome, because they usually only offer the ""express dozen"" through the drive thru, and the kids didn't want to go in, so the dude behind the speaker actually fulfilled my order as I wanted.

The only thing that bugs the hell out of me is that they charge for 2 donuts when you get a long john. :-(",high
"I have to admit that I find myself thinking that I like mine tall dark and Russian. 

 It's nice to have a coffee shop near by that's not Starbucks, has good coffee and reasonable prices.  So far I just stick with the house brew (which is smooth and not too bitter yet not too sweet) since the fancy coffee drinks usually have many calories that I do not need!  I have tried the blueberry muffin-quite yummy as well as the chocolate chip cookies- delicious.  The cafe is attached to The Great Indoors so you can people watch, browse thru design books or take a leisurely stroll through the design center.  It's a great way to unwind or perk up on your choice of caffeinated beverage.",high
"Sacks is a different kind of sandwich shop. They have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos, fresh spinach, grilled peppers, and all sorts of other things you don't see at a typical deli. Then they serve it up on a baguette, wrap, or wheat bread for about $6. The specials are particularly diverse and change daily. On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)

If you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special. 

From their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30. Seriously, give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed. 

Oh, and every sandwich comes with a lovely cookie. Brilliant.",high
"I love this restaurant!! I have been a fan of the Newport Beach location for years. Scottsdale definitely did not disappoint! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The drinks are fresh (worth the extra wait for the tasty Cucumber Jalapeño marg). And the food? Goes without saying, it's CRAVE worthy. This is a new location, so I expected the usual growing pains. But overall, a great dining experience. Welcome to the neighborhood, SOL Cocina!",high
"That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome. 5 stars.

"Came for a friend's birthday and really was not that impressed. First of all, it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back. On Saturday if you are there before 7pm, all alcohol was 1/2 off and some appetizers were on special. We ate dinner there and the menu was very limited. The food was okay, but our burgers were over cooked. The service was slow and it took us a while to get our check.

"Recently moved back to Mesa, I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread. This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich. My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly.",high
"Been there, done that.  Fair sandwiches (better than Safeway, anyway).  Only 2 stars since I didn't know about the free soft serve, so didn't get to try that.

This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.

Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like, seriously, I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake. 

It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always.

What a great ambiance! The outside patio is where it's at, with tons of seating and misters. Lots of beautiful decorations to stare at while you're waiting for friends to arrive, and the staff as well as fellow patrons are always very friendly.

When I feel like getting in touch with my hippie side I go to Casey Moores, because I can always expect to find someone outside painting a work of art, or photographing the wandering cats (yes, they have cats! they're well-fed and happy). 

It gets pretty busy after 5pm, but the good news is that if you arrive before 5 you can bring your pets and stay all night. I bring my dog in all the time, and she is always met with animal lovers who didn't know they could bring their pets.. so now you know!

The oysters are good, but if you're eating them out on the patio the heat kind of kills that deal for you. I had never tried oysters before going to Casey's but they are surprisingly tasty and comparatively better than other oyster houses.

They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJ'S!",high
We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day. I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome.

I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness.

That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like, at all, delivery pizza.

Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!

It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced ""gourmet"" pizza joint.

"Ate here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (don't quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).  

One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.

"You may think this is a cop out... writing a review of Starbucks. It's like writing a review of water. (""It's wet, delicious and necessary to my survival!"") 

My aim is simple here though. This particular Starbucks location is an excellent place for people watching. Try hanging out there between the hours of 11am and 1pm on a Friday afternoon and tell me you aren't entertained by some of the patrons who go in and out of the doors. While attending school, I was taking a screenwriting class and given the arduous task of writing descriptions of about 35 random people. Where did I go to write every single one of them? Park Central Starbucks. 

The crew here is also super friendly every time I come in and they do their best to remember my name. It doesn't help that I tell them a different name every time. OK that's not true, but what a fun social experiment that would make.

"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but.. well.. let me explain. 


I came in on a Friday around 5:15pm trying to catch an early dinner. I am glad I did as upon entering I noticed they close close @ 7:30pm. When I came in all the tables were empty but they all had ""reserved"" place cards on them. Later I realized that there was some sort of club or church organization that came in and took over the restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation. The owner was very nice and sat us at one of the reserved tables. Her husband the chief quickly realized we knew nothing about polish food and offered us a sample of dill sour pickle soup. yummmmmy. 

The restaurant itself is located in old town Glendale's Catlin court in a small quaint little house that gives you a more personal ambiance. The owners made us feel like we were literally dinner guest at their house which was not what I was expecting but a nice surprise. 

The food is best described as ""home cooking"". The soup was excellent and my favorite part of the meal but the rest tasted just as my parents would have made growing up at home and I'm not Polish. Put simply all the main ingredients of my dish tasted as though they could have been bought at Fry's and my mom cooked them. The kielbasa was good but nothing unique, sauerkraut was tasty, but the green beans were either overcooked, thawed from frozen, or from a can. I am by no means a Polish food expert and maybe this is exactly how they would make it in Poland? 

Overall if you don't feel like cooking, want to try something new, and are in the mood for Polish food I would try it out and see for yourself. As for me I did like the restaurant and their owners but I think I will only return for the soup in the future, which I would gladly give 5 stars.",high
"This is my first dinner stop anytime I'm in Scottsdale, and always makes me look good when I recommend it.

This time, the standouts were the ceviche, the crab queso, the lamb adobo, and the  Cadillac marg.  Tablemates had other dishes they raved about.

Noteworthy notes:

I've not yet sat on the patio, but I can't explain why.  It looks awesome.

The margaritas are sufficiently stiff.  They're not my preferred carburetor cleaning strength, but neither are they simply jazzed-up lemonade or those super-acidic-1.0 pH version you get some places.

The service was a little lax this time, less attentive than before, and that's the only reason I'm not giving LS a 5 this time.

If you're after Mexican when in Scottsdale, this is the first place to point your ride.",high
"Yes, the view is wonderful. Absolutely. 

Sadly, my table was near the entrance, limiting my ability to enjoy said view. Also, we are still in the summer months, so I was confused that there was a fire raging outside at night. 

The decor is wonderful, dark with different tones and moods. We arrived in the early evening, so I was surprised to see how dark the room would eventually become. I didn't find the table and its decor that exciting, but it will give it a pass. Not everything has to be practical art.

Our party consisted of five and we were certainly treated to a good sampling of what this place had to offer. Half of the party ordered off of the set price menu. This included a three course meal for something like fifty dollars. It may have even been less than that, but I'm not sure. This menu had an array of choices and wasn't limited to chicken or pork. 

I was impressed with the portions and the quality. The salads were crisp and the dressing wasn't overpowering, more of an accent, the way it should be. The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY, Ribeye and Salmon. I do agree with others who said that the sides were a little small, but I do think they were worth the price. I know for sure the cream of corn was, as it was treated with green chili and a bit of spice. 

The desert was alright. Not a great deal of variety. The textures were spot on, but the temperatures seems a bit off. If a dish was intended to be served warm, it was slightly too cold, etc.

The service was bad. Probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant. Our server left items off of the tab, forcing her to return and run the debit card three separate times. I am okay with someone making a mistake, but it should not take two attempts to correct. Also, my wife and I ordered Mojitos. They were very average. No sugar, which I assumed was standard fare for Mojiots, and amount of mint was rather low. I understand that drinks are open to a bartender's whim, so I won't dwell on this fact.

Valet had a bit of trouble with our car and keys, which was annoying.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience, food and atmosphere alike. However, the service did bring me down a bit.",low

I could see people in the back and the general manager talking on his cell phone.  I decided to ultimately leave rather than waste any more time.  Disappointing at best.",low

My boyfriend and I are always looking for new places to try and came upon this place on Yelp when our regular Saturday spot decided to no longer be opened for lunch Saturdays.

We ordered the Saturday special of Monte Cristo, the potatoes and the biscuits and gravy among other items.

That being said there food overall is OK. There meat salad and cal-zones are good and the servers are friendly. For all the people out there giving it more than 3 stars: try other pizza places like spinatos, la grande Orange, pizzeria Bianca.",high
"Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad, about 1/2 hour wait. Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in. 

About 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me. 
My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready. 
There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes.
Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy, chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns, bannana pecan caramel french toast",high
"OK, I've decided that other coffee shops sell swill. I think about Dazbog coffee in a dreamy sort of way, like unstressed people think about sex. I mourn often that they open so damn late in the morning. Seriously, I would be there every day... 

The chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up, even on the mushiest afternoon. No bitterness, not overly sweet, just blissful- in an I've-just-been-bitch-slapped-by-caffeine sort of way, of course. 

Oh, and the sandwiches I complained about? Replaced by real deli looking ones in clam-shells. Far more appetizing. But what the hell do I need a sandwich for when I can have a giant red velvet cupcake? 

Don't make me break out the voodoo, Dazbog. Just open at 6:00 am like any other coffee shop and we'll be BFFs.",high
"I am at work today, talking to my co-worker, letting her know that I was going to Taco Bell for lunch.  She looked at me disappointed, and said ""I never want to hear that you are gaining weight again...stop eating that!""  She then told me about Sacks....I decided that I would give it a shot. (not that is was any healthier....)
I wasn't real impressed with the layout of the place, even where it was located.  It was getting busy when I walked in...and had no idea what to order.  I ended up with the Van Gogh, which was roast beef, dill, alfalfa sprouts, cheese and I subsituted the marble rye for a tomato basil bread.  The girl at the counter was really sweet and helpful at helping me pick out what I wanted.  
My sandwich was really good, and it wasn't just a normal sandwich.  I also liked the little cookie that they snuck into my bag.  And the fact that they have Stewart's root beer was a nice bonus.
The only thing that I could say that was negative is that I left there still smelling the kitchen on my coat.  And it wasn't pleasant.",high
"Thank you, Mobile Yelp App!  Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe!

I arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done.

The waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.

I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.

Ambience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.

About 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.  

Jasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!

On completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.

For the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long.",high

"First, I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant.  Second, we miss the bloody mary bar too.  Hubby & I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner. We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong.  Okay, she doesn't know beer.  We liked the chips & salsa, it was a good start, then I took a sip of my water.  What the?  I know what Tempe tap water tastes like, but this was weird.  The aftertaste made me cringe, I couldn't drink it, even with a slice of lemon in it, maybe it was the ice.  Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas, which he orders practically everywhere, and it was so bad he didn't finish it.  My meal was not memorable either.  I wanted to love this place, or at least like it.  We walked out of there terribly disappointed, I doubt we'll go back.",low
"The food was flavorful and plenty of it. Eating with only your fingers is quite fun - make your momma proud. My girlfriend won the best dish of the night - lentils and chicken and cabage/carrots. It all had kind of sweetish/bitterish/spicy flavor. I had the lamb and jalapeño dish, which was kind of greasy. You eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you - a tartish type crepe, which goes well with the food. I'd be happy to go back and try something different.  If you are used to frozen pizzas and Burger King, you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume.",high

I know it was on the food channel, but honestly the food was sub-par. Maybe it was just an off day, but I have a feeling it wasn't. The prices were not outrageous, but it wasn't cheap either. The atmosphere was nice, if very cafeteria like.

Pad Thai noodles,the dish was dry and came out of the container in one giant clump. It tasted like plain noodles, i was glad I had peanut sauce in the fridge to,add to it. Then it was edible ....

While the service was impossibly slow, every waiter I came in contact with was extremely nice. But nice or not, I was sucking on melted ice for half the night while I waited to get my drinks refilled. No bueno. 

The atmosphere was relaxing and casual, and the bathrooms were fabulous!! Well lit, great aroma, and my choice between cloth hand towels or paper. The bathroom had well placed mirrors which made the space feel big and clean.

 He  put  plates of food  down and walked off, the order had nothing to do with ours.
We tried to get his attention,gave up and took a bite.
OMG, it was AWFUL,fried fish that tasted so fishy that I couldn't eat it.
At that point, the table next to us realized it was their meal , and got up and walked out .
 Finally I got the waiters attention, he took the plates ,gave us the correct meal, and didn't offer to do anything about all of our time he had wasted, let alone the mistake. Our real meal was O.K., I tried the tamales, wasn't blown away,my boyfriend said his steak was so-so. I don't think I would come back again.",high

When we sat down there was a birthday card signed by the employees of the restaurant -- a very nice touch.  For appetizers, we had oysters and the (best) crab cakes (anywhere).  Steaks and seafood as our main courses paired well with the red cabernet wine.  Overall, just incredible.  Completely up to par with Eddie V's standards -- comparing to Houston and Austin.  My mom forgot her sweater at the booth and a hostess ran out to give it to her.  We also got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how everything went.

"I had been craving sushi steadily for about two weeks, so I decided to try somewhere new. This place happens to be just across the street from my work and the reviews on here were a vote of confidence. 

I had the cherry blossom roll and rainbow roll, shared edamame, and hot green tea. The cherry blossom roll was good, not amazing, but good. The fish was fresh enough, and I did like the eel sauce drizzled on it. The rainbow roll was much less rainbow than I'm used to. The rainbow roll did have a bit of a fishy taste, and the whitefish on it was a pale yellowish brown color, and not as moist as it could have been. The crumbled macadamia nuts were and interesting and kind of fun garnish. The edamame was tasty, not over cooked, but could have used a little more salt. The green tea was boiling hot, with the kind of walnutty aftertaste you get from good green tea, I was disappointed it came in a single glass, not in a tea pot diffuser with a teacup like at most restaurants.

My girlfriend had pork katsu, the sauce drizzled on it was sweet and vinegary, but not too overwhelming. Gauging from the fact that she ate all of it I would assume it was pretty good. The salad that came with it was a bit strange, iceberg lettuce and a cream sesame dressing. The miso soup on the side was better than the little packets I get at the store, but didn't taste home made. It was not too salty, but the tofu must have been dehydrated, it was in tiny little shriveled squares on the bottom of the bowl. 

The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. It wasn't too busy when we went, about 5pm. The music was typical pop music, but thankfully unlike some places (RA for instance) its not blaring. 

I would say its definately not the best sushi I've ever had, not even the best I've had in arizona, but it was ok. The rainbow rolls at kobe are better.",high

We stayed at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch during spring break and had a fabulous time. We ate at SWB for lunch and enjoyed it so much we ordered dinner that evening to eat in the room with our kids. My husband ordered me the chocolate caramel tart which turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. I tried looking for the recipe and couldn't find it so I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for it. Surprisingly I received an almost immediate response from the hotel that they would let the chef know. Within a few hours the recipe from the chef was in my e-mail with additional tips! Now I call that customer service. We loved the hotel and loved the restaurant.

"Great new addition to Mill Ave. 

First stopped by here for a Monday Happy Hour, and instantly loved it. This is a perfect day-drinking place when the weather is nice, and they do a good job of creating a large indoor / outdoor space with plenty of patio. Happy Hour is pretty great - 1/2 off almost all beers. (they do well drink / wine specials too, but don't remember what they were. I think it was $1 off... but don't quote me on that.) Bottom line, I had 3 Firestone DBAs, and i think my bill was about 8 bucks before tip. Score. (normal beer prices are in the $5-6 range. A vodka gimlet not on happy hour (well vodka) cost me $4, which is right where it should be.)

Also made a return trip on a Saturday night, to get a feel for the weekend crowd. Not too bad, but mildly disappointed. I was hoping it would remain a little more of the chill day-time vibe, but come 10pm the music gets cranked up, and my group decided to move on to a place where we could actually have conversation without screaming. 

(sidenote: every bartender / waitress I've dealt with here has been really, super nice.)

"I have had it with the meat department at Whole Foods Market on Scottsdale Rd & the Mayo Blvd. They really suck.

I gave them another chance (out of desperation really) and they blew it!  I am so disappointed.  I purchased some turkey breasts there (3 of them) at around $30.00 for a 4 lb breast. I came home, froze two and cooked one. It smelled, but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats.

I trusted his opinion and cooked it. Upon slicing it up for dinner, I found that the free range turkey was very fatty. It was gross but no one got sick luckily.

Well, now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse. It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.

And it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one), I pulled out about 8 inches of thick, fatty, I don't even know what from it. Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too. What ever that stuff is, it is all gray and rotten.

They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them! 

I am not surprised. They have always been trouble. Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food. His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty ""I don't care"" attitude.

I spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!

The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted. The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time. It is really gross; top dollar for top trash! My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the ""questionable meat"" instead of throwing it out!  

I am still nauseous from the smell, sight and from touching all that gray, rotting gross stuff. BLEECH!!! I think I ate that in the last one!",low

The food is good.  I like that they have a variety of sandwhiches and they put a lot of things on the sandwiches which can easily be taken off for the picky folks like me unlike other places where things are mixed in and not removable.  If you are looking for a good tastey sandwhich, this is a great place to check out.  If you are looking for a nice relaxing lunch where you can find a seat, move along.",high
"tried this place due to a restaurant.com gift certificate, 4 stars for service, we had an awesome and attentive server which made it great for first visit. drinks were good. went with friends and did some sharing to try the different dishes we ordered. the salmon quesadillas was on the fishy side, the pollo relleno good but a little dry and didnt get the poblano and goat cheese flavors that drew me to choosing the dish, the cilantro mousse sounded more interesting on the menu but was cream cheese and cilantro, the Obama burrito was the winner on our table though. great salsa. would come back and try other dishes and tae in some live music.",high
"Came here for lunch recently with active Yelper and friend Brett B. I'm sure he'll post up his own review of the place.

This is the kind of place you walk up to the register and place your order, then take a plastic number to your table and the server brings you your food. You also get your glass and go fill 'er up at the fountain yourself. I wasn't sure what to expect, but felt good vibes the minute I asked ""how big is the salad"" and the guy at the register walked into the kitchen to bring me a dish to show me. That was nice and above my expectation, as most places the servers will make a ""size"" with their hands and shrug and say, ""i don't know... about like this?"" So, yeah. I like that this guy actually showed me a plate and made a ""mound"" with his hand to show me some kind of size of the salad. 

When I ordered ""just water"" he went to give me a plastic cup with a lid, and then said, ""you know what? Just take a regular glass, it's more comfortable...."" He trusted me not to fill up my glass with anything but water (and I did only drink water). That was nice, and made me feel like an adult. Not like at some places (much cheaper than this place) that give you a plastic cup like the ones you pee in at the doctor's office, when you order water.

I really enjoyed my lunch here - Had a chicken caesar salad (one of my favorite things to order pretty much anywhere i go because I'll never make it at home), along with a cheese pizza.

The caesar salad - for those who have a love affair with this meal - was ""perfect"" . The portion was generous, and it was chopped and tossed. The chicken was shredded and mixed in with the salad, which makes SUCH a difference in getting an even distribution, and reducing pain-in-the-ass-ness of having to cut up a chicken breast atop a salad with oversized utensils like at so many other places. It was perfectly dressed too - not too heavy, just right. And the parmesan cheese was shaved over it, rather than shredded or grated. Nice touch. Excellent flavor, every mouthful.

The cheese pizza was a cripsy, ultra thin crust, delicious red sauce (kinda sweet, in a good way), and the cheeses were mozzarella and fontina - the saltiness mixed really well with the sweetness of the sauce and made this simple pizza taste extraordinary.

Granted, having had some beyond-extraordinary pizza in new york, I'm spoiled and have to say it was not as good as my favorite thin crust pizza from Totonno's in NYC's upper east side. But still, darn good. I'd eat it again. (I took some home and it didn't look like it heated up well later on when my husband was having it).

Brett had the tomato, gorgonzola, chicken, salad on mixed greens. I think it had pine nuts too. I got to taste it and it was even more flavorful than mine. Either one of these would be an excellent choice for those of you who like to order salads. Delicious. 

And the service was great! The  manager even came by our tables to refill our glasses for us, though the drinks were self-serve from a fountain. the place was not busy when we got there, but it picked up as we were finishing our meals. 

Great food - great service - great vibe. I hope this place sticks around. 

Definitely would eat there again. Looking forward to it, even!",high
"This place was so bad on so many levels I'm not even sure where to begin. Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?

So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert. 

Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night? It was so bad I wouldn't ever go back to find out.",low
"If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars, I might have.  The chips and salsa are the ONLY thing that requires a star here.

The service was less than average, the food was hotter than the surface of the sun, and the drinks were teeny tiny (and didn't much taste like alcohol).  My husband ordered a green chile dish and it came smothered in red sauce, when he asked the waiter if it looked green or red, the server said, ""nope that's what green looks like"".  WOW!

Sorry but I don't think I will be returning.",low

"Decentfood, but horrible service. Both servers walked by me three times while I was sitting inside without acknowledging me at all. I was by myself and felt as though everyone else that came walking in were immediately welcomed.  I wish I would have received the same attention. I was ready to walk out when i was finally approached. Nobody came back to check on me to make sure everything was ok after they delivered my food. Being from Vegas I am not accustomed to such non attentive service staff. I guess that flys here in Scottsdale, but I expected more from the type of clientele that they have. On a positive note, they do have a cozy place that gives the feel of a French coffee shop/bistro. Hopefully this review will be helpfull in giving them insight into making sure that every guest is treated with the same attentiveness to service.",high
"A girlfriend and I have been meaning to check Bombay Spice out for a while but have never gotten around to it until last night. (I found a great deal on LocalDines.com -use ref # 102729 if you sign up! Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! ) 

We ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice.

We both had wine, the ""single glass"" serving is actually 2 glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.)

Neither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who aren't sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved!

We also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant. 

I will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce. 

There are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu. Their menu also boasts that everything, except for 9 or 10 items, is completely Gluten free.

Good experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal.",high
"I found Cake Frenzy through an service listing on Craigslist while looking for someone to create our wedding cake/cupcakes. Not only were we on a tight budget we only had about 2 1/2 months to plan for the venue we wanted only had a few dates available. I met Jennifer about a month prior, my fiance' and I knew we wanted a peanut butter & jelly cake and she happily obliged. I emailed her a picture of what I wanted and the day of our wedding when I first saw our cake I almost cried. She went above and beyond my expectations. The cake was beautiful with sugar flowers and gelatin butterflies. All of our guests loved the flavor combinations and the decorations. I highly recommend Cake Frenzy, she is professional, she takes pride in her work and extremely reasonable.",high
"I have been coming here for the past 4 years; the pizza and food are great.  The service has been very good, some seasonal workers and some regulars.  I bring friends from out of town here for good pizza and wings.  I would recommend it any time.",high
"I love the kitsch of this place! Bears bears everywhere! Black Bear Diners are usually found in small to medium sized towns, but for some reason this one is smack in the middle of urban sprawl. So not complaining though, because it means I don't have to drive to the middle of nowhere to enjoy their old-timey newspaper-menu and awesome pot roast! 

Their fare is strictly comfort food and always well-prepared. The full portions will fill an average 200lb guy, so it's nice that smaller folk like myself have the option of getting the small (or ""senior) portion! 

Save room for their personal-sized pies...you won't regret it!",low
I have since revisited the store several times and I would be remiss if I didn't update my rant.  Debbie the owner has been friendly and helpful ever since I asked nicely.  I suppose with the amount of lookie loos or window shoppers in Old Town I can relate to the lack of enthusiasm.,high
"Spa whore, I am! I work in the industry, live in the industry and have breathed the industry for the last 5 years so I know spas. After a few stressful weeks of work, school and planning a wedding I suddenly remembered I am a better version of myself when I take adult time outs. My ""corner"", so to speak, was at Joya spa. I just so happen to remember a TravelZoo purchase I made a few months ago for a massage or facial at Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort in Phoenix.
Boy, was I excited! I called, booked an appointment with a male therapist and started to prepare myself for my next great spa adventure. 
After anxiously awaiting  Sunday to roll around, I finally found myself walking into a Moroccan paradise. The space was entrancing from the moment I walked in. It smelled like a spa and helped to set the mood for my day of relaxation. I was given a full tour of the facilities and allowed to set my intentions with small crystals in a round room, and then brought into a room with a GIANT crystal used to help calm, bring intention and awareness of your visit and to yourself. The woman giving me the tour was very professional and thorough. Though informative, I was waiting for a warm connection from her, and never received it.
After being led to the locker room, I changed into my bathing suit and waited in the woman's lounge for my provider to find me and take me back for my massage experience.
I chose a male provider. Knowing I had tension, knots and stress I was hoping for a firm, slow, relaxing massage. I have had MANY massages and this one was actually a little disappointing. My therapist picked me 7 minutes late and ended 5 minutes early. The strokes consisted of a lot of rocking and fast movements. Not really the relaxing experience I was craving. My massage therapist was very sweet and genuine in his approach, I was just hoping for something more.
I definitely didn't let my treatment ruin my experience! The facilities were amazing!  They were clean and always stocked with towels. I have to say the spa attendants ROCKED!!!!! I could not believe how efficient they were. I observed on 5 occasions (YES 5) every time a shower was vacant an attendant was there to clean it up, any time a towel was on the floor, it got picked up immediately. They worked together like a well oiled machine! And I would love to give them props for making me take notice to the work the do!
I plan on returning! I may not receive a massage because of my experience, but I truly enjoyed the facilities and the staff. I'm even thinking of booking a suite for my bridal party to enjoy the day there. In the end, if you know massage the way I do, please beware, you may not get all the bang for your buck in your treatment.",low
"Alright, went back last night, felt bad because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect.  The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so well done.

Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love...",high
"I didn't eat here, so I guess I can't give a full review. But I did have a beer, and I did take the Orbit to downtown Tempe, and I walked over here and had a yummy pint for 2 bucks on Sunday evening.

"Fabulous place.  The food is good and the selection of organic and specialty items is nice.  Love the butcher shop and Jerry the Cellarmaster is abslutely fantastic.  Seriously, if you want a bottle of wine - he is the best resource.  And if you go back frequently he tailors his suggestions to what you like.  My favorite thing about this store is that the staff tries so hard to treat you like a valuable customer.  They remember your name, ask after your kids and honestly act like they like you.  It feels like a small town grocery store and I love that.   Breakfast is fantastic and the coffee is great.  Everyone at the coffee counter is terrific.  This was a really great addition to the neighborhood.",high
"Hands down my favorite coffee shop in town. They used to be located inside the Conspire art collective but have now moved into the old Hood Rides digs up the block and it's awesome.

Plenty of seating room at the bar and also a really cool little room next door  where you can pull up a seat and hang out. From what I understand there will be seating outside too.

Most importantly however is the coffee. They use a special mix roasted specially by Cartel. I'll be the first to admit I'm no coffee connoisseur but I do know this, every drink I've had, no matter who's behind the bar has been perfect. Not burnt, not too sweet, and not a hint of pretentiousness.

Sooooo, why go to S-word Bucks when you can get a better cup of coffee up the street. Oh and for those of us who burn the midnight oil on more than a few occasions, they're open until 12am EVERY night.",high
"Tacos, tacos, tacos......how can something so simple be this great? Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny! I have a thing for always trying the ""odd"" menu items so I've tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu! This place is rather small which makes it perfect if you're there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself. Go to this place for some great authentic, local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!",high
My buddy and I (along with our dogs) stop by here every morning on the way to dog park. Hot coffee and hot women making the coffee! Love this place!,high
"This past weekend I went to The Vig Uptown twice because it was that  good. This is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu. What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill. The cherry on top is the games they have to offer, Bocce and Bags!

Drinks
1. Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order, made with Vodka/Ginger beer and fresh lime juice. 
2. If you bring in your own ""pimp cup"" any size, They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup.

Food
1. VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing.
2. Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i've ever had so I highly recommend getting them.",high
"HELLISH HELLISH SUMMER WEATHER (March thru October)
it hurts my lungs to breath.

I couldn't get transcripts because I had a parking ticket I needed to pay.
The problem is... *i DON'T OWN A CAR, I don't drive, I don't even have a drivers license*!!
~*~*-- aside from that one minor incident,~*~*

I paid 9000 USD a semester to receive a so and so education.
I graduated with a magna cum laude. I have attended other universities. However, I couldn't help but notice the gap in the quality and variety of classes offered.

For example, you have to be a finance major to take upper level interesting finance classes.

Business school was so and so, a lot of repetition.
Very little hands-on and help with internships.
Way too much groupwork and free-riding.
They do not have many good employers at their semi annual recruiting events.

Oh, and professors rarely teach the courses.
They have their teaching assistants teach us.

Also, there is a lack of bridging classes between lower level and upper level classes.
 Junior year when you get admitted into the ""professional program"" the level of the classes and transition isn't too smooth.

The campus tutoring program is pretty helpful for general classes if you're having trouble with classes (usually lower level)

There are not enough chairs/desks in some classes.
The students sit on the floor and cram on the stairs in the lecture halls.

Also, the classes don't teach you how to think critically, which I think is crucial in college.
Please don't waste your money, especially those of you from out of state. Its not worth it.

Expect to wait in line wherever you go.
ASU accepts way too many people.
It would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them.

Thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes I need.
The advisors are walking advertisements of the business school.
They are not informed enough to advise you.

I got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so I could not move on to the next level.... even after pre-registration.
I got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate.

Tuition rose from 6000 a semester in Fall of 2003 to 9000 + in Fall of 2007.
Gross!!

One thing I liked was the student theatre performances. The admission $ was reasonable and quite entertaining.

The College of Architecture and Environmental design studios are pretty good and has good security.

ASU is not the most safe neighborhood.
I have been approached by many shady people.

do NOT live on campus. Especially the dorms on north campus.
They are beyond crappy and overpriced.
You have to split your room with a room mate in most cases for undergrads.
The ""freshman year experience"" bullsh*t they pull on you, don't buy it.
and Please PLEASE please don't move into Manzy Hall (Manzanita; 15 stores with triangular windows).

I lived here my froshy year and its the dirtiest (rats), unhealthy (mold, pot circulation), most promiscuous place on campus.

Again, please don't bother wasting your money, especially if your an out of state or international student. 
Hope this helps.",low
"I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a ""GOOD"" Pizza. After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza, I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia! I love the hole in the wall vibe! Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty! The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..It's what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads. I want to try their Philly Steak next, but for the time being I still make mine at home.

"Lets just set the record straight here. Zoe's serves Mediterranean just like Qdoba serves Mexican.

When I say just like the Q, I mean the entire experience. Walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel; which is probably because they are in fact a chain of restaurants. Zoe's food was average and unimpressive. I did like the hummus though. Their prices similar to independent and family operated Mediterranean around the valley; in some cases more. I would prefer to visit Cypress Grill, just up the street from this location, they're my favorite Medi in CenPho so far. 

The staff here was friendly, they took our order promptly and served the food within a few minutes. Don't get me wrong, the food was in no way ""bad"", per se. I just can't shake the feeling of ""I've had better"" when thinking about my experience.

If you're looking to fill your belly with food just because it's time to eat, this might just be the place for you. If you're interested in a great Mediterranean meal, I implore you to please try something new. I likely won't be returning, we do live in the city of a million restaurants, go out and choose one! (but don't take me at my word on that just made up fact).

Happy Yelping Phoenix, now where's my hummus?",low
"Popped into Sol Mexican Cocina before a movie one night for Happy Hour.  We were seated quickly, which was great because there was only 15 minutes left for happy hour and we wanted to get our order in before it ended.  Our waitress was SOOO... nice!  She had a great personality and was attentive and informative, pretty much everything you would want in a waitress.

We ordered everything off the happy hour menu, so I can't comment on the main menu, but the happy hour food was great!  The Hubs and I shared the pork tacos and chicken tacos - he loved the chicken and I loved the pork - go figure.  We shared guacamole, which was good, but needed a bit more seasoning.  By adding the salsa, which was served with it, it became quite good.  BTW, love the unique ""chips"" that are served here... some of our had a ton of seasoning and others had only a little - we liked the ones with just a little.  We also shared the empanadas (I think that's what they were), anyway they were really good.

Overall, we had a great happy hour experience here.  It thoroughly redeemed my not so enthusiastic impression from the Yelp event here (just about the food, not the event).  I can't say enough great things about our waitress - can't remember her name, but she was awesome.  I am sure we will be back soon to try out their main menu.",high
"I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday.

We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot.  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from, all at very fair prices.  YUMMY!",high

"Okay I have found my new favorite ""home office!""  I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.

Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.

The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.

A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich.",high
"I really liked the experience I had at Marcellino's on Friday night.  They had opera singers from the Phoenix Symphony performing which were very good.  I enjoyed my handmade ravioli with spinach and yummy cheese (not fish yay!) filling and the wine and the mouse.  It was good!! 

But then something happened....my date gave the server his card to pay for the meal and it was brought back as not able to be processed (yikes!).  The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.

Then, the next day, he checked his account and he'd been charged twice!! :( sad, because I thought I might like to go back at some point.",low
"This place is amazing. Absolutely LEGIT. Some of the best shawarma and hummus in the US (Zankou Chicken in LA is a close competitor). The pita sandwiches are stuffed with delicious fresh meat, traditional pickles, and tahini or garlic dressing (depending on preference). Ask for their hot sauce to help spice things up even more. And the Jasmine infused lemonade is crazy sweet, but really good.

"They're really slipping now.  With dinner, you get cole slaw - you can ""upgrade"" to soup or salad for 2.50 more.  Really?  I've never heard of cole slaw being a pre-meal before.  I got the French Onion Soup, its actually better at Mimi's.  They put way too much cheese, the bread is pathetic and there's hardly any onions in it.

The prime rib comes with horseradish - very weak and cut with butter.  Never heard of that before either.  Luckily I had some sour cream with my baked potato and I asked for some raw horseradish so I can concoct my own.  Wasn't the best, but way better than the butter!  

The barbeque chicken was ok.  I've had better at diners.  They didn't really season the bird, just threw some barbeque sauce on it.  At least it wasn't terribly dry...

I don't think I'm coming back to this one.  Nooooo..",low
"Like anyone else with good taste, I think this place was better when it was called ""The Library"". IDK when their specials are, but the first jager bomb was $2 on a Tuesday night, and I'll love them forever just on that alone.

I've been to several Lowe's/Home Depot's in the past, but I feel compelled to review this location, because after 10+ trips (mostly on the weekends), I have never had to wait for assistance or behind more than one customer in line.

"Let's be honest, when you walk into a tanning salon if you have high hopes you'll expect to see a nice person behind the counter who is friendly and can tell you the prices for packages and the max times on the beds.  If you have low expectations you'll expect a bored teenager who hands you a price sheet and stares at you looking bored.

Walking into the Total Tan I had pretty good expectations based on the reviews and even those were blown away.  Dallas was the person who helped me (I think he's one of the owners?) and he was sooooo friendly and knowledgeable I spent more than I was originally planning but I feel good about it actually.

I had looked at the pricing online so I had an idea of what I wanted but he explained things about the beds that I never knew and that none of the other salons I'd been to had ever told me.  He was super personable too, even asking for my name just during his explanations of everything before I had committed to buying anything.  He made sure I knew every detail of the beds, the differences, gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it.  During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I don't think he had to ask for their names once, a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers.

I could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself (super clean, trendy, nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels) but I think you get the point by now.  Just check this place out, you'll be happy you did.",high
"OK, yeah, everyone LOVES teriyaki, we know!

Well, don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here!  It may look like a little pre-processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside, but they're a die hard home-made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment!

I'd highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl! You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ, yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional, but not too expensive! I'd love to explain the mystique of this dish, but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that's coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable.  Well, to them I say you should educate your tongue, and expose it to some delicious culture! 

There's also Orange chicken... This dish is completely the bee's knees. It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers.

Their house beef? Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms? Heaven.  Simple and delicious.

And I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.  Their fried rice might seem a little ""heavy"" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil, but it outclasses all competitors.  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp, it's sweet garlic love.  Seriously, their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.

As I've been eating here for far longer than I'd like to admit, I'd have to say I might be a little biased.  But, for the great unique quality and cheap price, I guarantee you're not going to find any better in AZ!",high

"I've been to corporate events, concerts and Spring Training games here, and I've been consistently surprised at how well they do what they do.  

First the field.  At Spring training games you are so close you feel like you're watching a little league game.  The grass is go green it almost looks fake (it's not).  And the backdrop of office and apartment buildings is decidedly suburban.  I finally get the big draw.  

Next - the vendors. Taco in a bag (must experience to believe).  Strawberries and banana dipped in chocolate on a stick.  Great pizza.  Amazing choices of beer.  Oh, if only they had a selection of soda the way they had a selection of beer.  

Parking is plentiful and the grounds are always kept neat.  Folks who work there have all been helpful and friendly.  It may feel like it's forever away from our Phoenix core, but it's not to far for an experience that BOB or Chase Field could never provide.",high

"Being a fan of the infamous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Long Beach, I was totally down for some chicken and waffles this morning. The bestie found this place because it was close to my new home in Arizona and was sure to be a hearty brekky after all the physical exertion of packing, moving and loading/unloading a Uhaul. So off we went...

The place is easy to find and pleasant to walk into. The staff was friendly immediately upon arrival. Service was quick and attentive. The menu is simple but appealing...so are the prices. We decided to go with the traditional chicken and waffle plates to satisfy the savory and sweet tooth. Waffles are big, maple syrup is warm and the chicken is perfectly southern fried. 

I'm afraid I have to admit that I may now be thinking of LoLo's first whenever I hear chicken and waffles. MmmMmm!",high
"Today I was ready to be beside myself with glee as I took my daughters out for lunch. I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch, and have never been disappointed. They have the BEST eggs!  I also love the layout and of course, the free wifi. August is their ""Burger Daze"", a different burger every day for the entire month. Today's burger was the wasabi burger, and being a fan of foods with kick, I was thinking about this burger since yesterday. It almost makes me cry to say I was underwhelmed by it. It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it, and you got a little wasabi flavor, but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi. It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts). The burger just wasn't good enough to get me to come back 9 more times this month.  

I'll definitely return to Liberty Market again- as I said I do love the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat. However I think I'll stick to their breakfasts and other sandwiches. The three stars is for today only- next time I hope to come back here and give them a 5!",low
"This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot. Pho-real! Impeccable service and the freshest food. Their spring rolls ate immaculate, fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice, and their pho is truly unphoghetable. The servers are friendly, the owner always asks you how the food was. Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine.",high
"Stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon for a milkshake when my sister was visiting from out of town. We browsed the racks of vintage clothing and costume jewelry before sitting down at the bar. It was difficult to choose our milkshake flavor, given the dizzying array of syrups and ice cream combos, but after settling on chocolate and wild cherry, we were very pleased. Plus it was a cheerful looking thing, topped with whipped cream, colorful sprinkles, and a cherry.
I was not as pleased with the service... it wasn't busy until after we sat down, but no one took our order or even gave us a menu or a ""hello"" until we'd been sitting for about 10 minutes. A party of 8 or so, including a bunch of indecisive kids, sat down AFTER us, and were served before my sister and I... and no acknowledgement of the wait. While we waited, I did enjoy looking at all the cool decor from the past, though I think the whole place could be a little bit cleaner.",high

"Same great Lolo's fried chicken and waffles without the risk of getting stabbed or shot... and it WAS worth the risk to visit their South Phoenix location on occasion. The food is that good, it might even be the ultimate in comfort food! Lucky for us they have a new Scottsdale location where the most dangerous situation you could encounter might be a hungover Scottsdale ""clubber"" (who could scratch you with their Ed Hardy bling).

The only suggestion I have for them is to drop the prices about 25%",high
"Dropped by for a manicure, and as soon as I sat down, my manicurist started talking in rapid Vietnamese. I couldn't see her headset so I thought she was speaking to me, but obviously she wasn't. In fact, she never looked at me during the lightning fast manicure, except in confusion when I said I didn't want her to cut my cuticles -- just push them back. She really didn't understand that, and asked me in broken English why I was getting a manicure but not getting my cuticles cut. She didn't have an attitude about it, but was just really confused. I think after that exchange, she told whoever was on her phone about it.

I also thought it was strange that she asked me to wash my hands after giving me a lotioned hand massage -- sort of defeats the purpose of applying lotion to my hands in the first place? 

The whole experience was perfunctory, but didn't leave me wanting to return for a manicure. Not asking for a great nail technician, but it would have been nice if she acknowledged my existence other than doing my nails, and most importantly if she asked whether I wanted them cut round or square because I wanted them round!  I would have interrupted her phone conversation to let her know my preference, but she was so fast to dunk my hands back into the soaking dish that I didn't see what they looked like!",high
"In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.  The service is the best just like their steaks.  I recommend the Caesar salad, fillet, creamed spinach, cream corn, garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here.",high
"We had a very difficult time finding trail 201 which was noted as one of the more strenuous hikes. We took trail 100 and came across some extreme mountain bikers, several other hikers and a couple who gave us confusing directions on how to reach one of the highest sections of the mountain. We got lost and ended trail busting which is highly discouraged but give us rules and we will break  em. During our run back down the trail I took a pretty hard fall face planting into the dirt, stabbing my right hand into a rock and banging up my knee. No broken bones or teeth, thankfully. We had just passed a couple of hikers when I took the fall so they saw everything. I laid there for about 10 seconds, jumped back up, noticed the blood, my torn tee and just continued on with the hike. We came across a park ranger who was standing outside his truck and asked if he had any medical supplies. Unfortunately, his first aid kit was about 20 years old and didn't contain anything that would help any of my wounds. We found a CVS on our way home and picked up some medical supplies and my wounds were washed and bandaged in the parking lot. 

Probably my most memorable hike thus far.",high
Excellent service and food.  Best tex-mex in the valley.,high
"I love cupcakes. Its true. I really do. I have waited in an hour long line outside of Magnolia Bakery in NYC to experience the bakery that started the cupcake craze. That said, if there is a good cupcake to be had, I'm on my way to experience it. I must note- that I am not a fan of Sprinkles; as I think they are overly dry and waayy too hyped.

We just ordered two dozen different flavors from Mind Over Batter to celebrate our August birthdays (its a tradition we do once a month from baker's around town). Because of my love for all thinks coffee- I got the Carmel Mocchiato. Let me just say- i wished I took a picture. But I couldn't help but to dive in. Mocha Buttercream frosting-piled high, crushed coffee toffee and carmel drizzle. 

I also heard rave reviews from the office about the Birthday Cake and the Chocolate Red Velvet. The one I most want to try is the Lemon Drop (because I love lemon).

I'll be back in very soon to check out more flavors and cake pops.",high
"I know its gonna sound a bit foolish when I divulge that I was actually a bit scared to enter the Roadrunner Lounge, but the truth is that I was.  Due to its lack of windows and barebones facade, I concluded that this bar had the possibility of being the sort of place where, when I opened the door, I might bare witness to a mob boss or two trying to decide what they should do with the man they just shot...  but that wasn't the case.

What I discovered was a long corridor flanked by mirrored walls and strings of multicolored lights, as well as ample seating and classic video games to boot.  The games included PacMan and Golden Tee, accompanied by a dartboard and a pool table - enough to keep the gamer in any of us busy for at least a few hours of drink-sippin.

The drinks were cheap and strong, and the tunes were decent - however the digital jukebox put a frown on my face; I hoped for a Wurlitzer.  Our barkeep was friendly and efficient, and our drinks were strong and low-priced.  I think tap beer's only two bucks, and mixers aren't too much more.

In conclusion, the next time you're feeling a bit nostalgic, and you're looking for a watering hole off the beaten path, kick a few back at the Roadrunner.  Bottom's up!",low
"A bit disappointed so writing after only one exploratory visit and a revisit for the one dish that deserved an encore.

The Ossobucco was the major disappointment, A beautiful Presentation that lacked flavor and was past overcooked. One of my favorite dishes when prepared correctly, but they just missed - badly!

On the plus side the Gnocchi were little pillows of wonderfulness! Reminded me on our neighborhood  ""little Italian lady"" who made it for me as a child over 60 years ago and was, until now, the very best I have ever had. This version was very close and was served with a wonderful four cheese white sauce (calorie free for certain!). The Caesar Salad was a decent rendition but nothing I have eaten here approached the Gnocchi, unfortunately.

Worth the trip for the Gnocchi alone!",low
"If it wasn't for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year.  The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second. Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie, I order a salad only. Because they do catering, I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers.  

The service is OK. They have a couple of generic draft beers. Everything is overpriced.  Caveat Emptor if you order an entree.",low
"Never. Again. *hork* 

I have been to this location a couple of times. My friends LOVE this place, and I really wanted to at least like it. But here I sit typing out my review and fighting the urge to double over the trash can at my desk. I can't remember the last time I felt so sick! 

A few things about last night's dinner stand out...as negative. But I'll start with the positive, which bumped the review up from 1 star to 2. 

POSITIVE: 

Our waitress was very friendly and chipper. 

NEGATIVE: 

But alas, it was not enough. We ordered edamame, 4 rolls and a couple of sake bombers...um...but the ""shot glass"" was too big to fit in the glass...so that no worky. 

The waitress asked if we wanted everything to come at once or if she should bring them out as they were prepared...we chose the latter... 

1) we never got our edamame, 

2) it took 30 minutes before the first roll came out (with no wasabi or ginger??), the next 2 rolls took an additional 30 minutes, and the 4th roll was about 5-10 minutes after that... 

3) the spicy yellowtail (roll #3) had obviously turned, it smelled like bad fish, which I unfortunately didn't realize until it had already made it's way into my mouth...I felt instantly sick and haven't been right since then, which means I didn't even get to enjoy a taste of the 4th roll because I didn't trust it anymore. 

POSITIVE: 

She took the yellowtail off our bill...which seems like it would be a no-brainer, but you never know these days. 

NEGATIVE: 

No apology for serving us bad fish, and no acknowledgment from the mgr on duty, which should be standard operating procedure at a restaurant. 

Also, the acoustics are not conducive to having any sort of conversation. The music was at a decent level, but for some reason, the place is just REALLY loud. 

And finally, and this is just a matter of personal preference, I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement. It's set up in a way so that you are rubbing elbows with other parties and unable to avoid being all up in their kool-aid... 

POSITIVE: 

For the moment, I'm still alive (which feels like a negative right now, but I'm hoping that this current wave of nausea will be the last).",low

"Yeah...notsomuch.

Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...

- The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.

- This place is a disorganized mess. 

- There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.

- The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like ""um...there might be a better way to do this...""

- Also, the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb?

So get this: I attempted to order a bottle of water. I told the clerk it's 100+ degrees outside, I walked there and I'm realllllllly thirsty. The idiot at the counter told me ""You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it."" I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said ""NO"" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word ""water"") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.

I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!"" 

I said ""It's quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion."" (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)

She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 5'4"" 110 lbs of fury. Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her. Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone. 

I must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion. And I'm mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes, yo.",low

"Not the WORST place, but nowhere NEAR the best place, I've ever been.

Went in, back in January, for a dinner around 9:30, on a rainy night with my beau. It took 15 minutes for our waitress to stop, acknowledge our existence, and take our drink order. By that time, we had decided our food order, and gave her that, too. Another 10 minutes later, we received our beverages. another 25 minutes later, we received our order, and my chili cheese fries were decidedly bland, while his hamburger was worse than McDonalds. Minus that his regular fries were actually good.

I'm pretty sure that will be my only experience at SPS's. The decorations were pretty awesome though.",high
"I had Smashburger for the first time a couple of days ago and I was not impressed. My burger was way too greasy. The smashfries were good but they were greasy as well. I'm not expecting for my burger to be dry but there is a major difference between juicy and greasy and they crossed over into the land of the grease. And they were heavy handed with the salt. Unless I want my sodium intake for the week in 1 day, I would suggest that they move away from the salt.

They are similar to Five Guys in that they have no combos but they have more options. I can see what the appeal is and maybe the cook was having a bad day but between the grease and the salt I will not be going back unless I have a death wish.",high
"Attention margarita lovers- you MUST order the Chambord Margarita. Delicious (and dangerous) and oh so tasty!

The restaurant is always busy because it is at Fashion Square but the service is always prompt. The patio/bar area upstairs is open seating so you can usually snag a table up there even during busy times.

The cornbread they bring to your table is really yummy but sometimes you have to ask for it to make sure that they bring you some.

I have had a large variety of of things on the menu and never been disappointed. The seasonal menus they offer are great as well and i definitely recommend branching out and ordering off of that menu every once in a while.

Definitely our ""go to"" place for drinks and dinner.",low

Fresh greens, goat cheese, fresh strawberries, bell peppers, onions, glazed pecans, chicken and this amazing viniagrette dressing! Wowwy Mowwy!  Oh, and it comes with a crusty buttery cheesy bread.  I have had a few run ins with bad waiter service, but the manager was always quick to come by our table to ask if anything else was needed.  As long as I get what I ordered and I dont have to poke around their tables to make ""eye contact"" with my server I'm ok.  They know they will get a mideocre tip if their service is so-so.  It's on them.  My mother got a red velvet cupcake on the house for her birthday! That was nice.",high
"Good lord.  I don't ask for much.  I ordered a slice of quiche and an iced coffee.  They didn't have to bake the quiche, just warm it up.  I waited 15 minutes and then went to the counter to ask for it.  The server looked confused and the Guy who took my order said he ""got lost.""  I heard the server apologize to at least three tables (but not to me).  She told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel (the last one in the shop) and insisted repeatedly that SHE didn't burn it--it was the toaster's fault.  Quiche was tasty, though.  The server said it was mushroom and spinach, so I had to wonder for a minute what the bright red things in my quiche were...then, I figured out it was mushroom and chard.  Coffee was ""eh.""  The floor looked dirty.  There was a paper towel in the toilet.  Ok, I'm nit-picking now.  The place was moderately busy; the small private parking lot was full.  Fortunately, I was on my scooter, so I could squeeze into a non-parking space easily.",high

The other day we went in and my husband insisted I try red wine instead of sticking to my usual Riesling (I don't like change).

ASU boys think that these are the best carne fries. Me thinks not. The carne fries consist of boiled meat AND the order is wrong. It's supposed to have the guacamole on top of the sour cream on top of the melted cheese over the meat, but they just dumped the boiled carne asada on top of the sour cream. I told some ASU boy about this, but he said that I probably had a different person making my carne fries  the wrong way.

"When I was in highschool various clubs used to sell Karsh's bagels around campus to raise money. I would buy a bagel and cream cheese and hide it in my backpack to munch on during class. Soooo good!
 I was feeling nostalgic one day and decided to pop in for a bagel and cream cheese. 
The guy behind the counter was nice enough, I told him my order which came to $2.95 or something just barely under $3.  I had failed to notice the sign which said they do not accept credit cards for purchases under $3. I apologized and said I didn't have any cash and offered to run the the ATM.  The guy behind the counter very nicely asked other lady behind the counter  (the owner? manager on duty maybe?) if she would let me use my card.

I mean come on, there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time, he didn't check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell.

The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best I've tasted.

The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriend's favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special.

There is no indication next to the names of the yogurts what ingredients are in it, so I am docking a star for that. I'm trying to avoid eating eggs as much as I can and it is always helpful when that information is available without having to ask. I have been on the website enough times now to know which flavors have eggs and which don't so its not a problem for me anymore, but for anyone else it would be. But the flavors I have had have all been good. The fruity pebble flavor I had awhile ago actually tasted just like the cereal. It was a fun flavor. 

The topping bar is a good size. There are fruits, candies, and nuts among other toppings. My husband and I are generally happy with this topping bar. 

The best thing about this location is on Wednesdays, if you come in wearing pajamas (or something resembling pajamas) you get 50% off your total! Its a great deal. The last time we only paid $5 for the two of us. It gets pretty busy on Wednesdays but its not too bad.",high

I met my friend Melanie H for dinner this evening and we really enjoyed our meal... we had great service - our waters stayed filled throughout the time we were there, and our food was served promptly. Our server checked on us several times as well.  We started with vegetable pot stickers and requested that they come steamed.  They were delicious! Next, we shared 'Indian Curry Vegetables' (I ordered it with shrimp) and Indian Vindaloo Chicken.  Both were extremely tasty - fresh veggies, chicken, and shrimp in really flavorful sauces with just the right amount of spice.  The curry vegetable dish came with broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, snow peas, and long beans.  The chicken dish had tomatoes and onions. We also had steamed white rice.

Note to Flo: We were both disappointed that you took the Vietnamese Spring Rolls off of the menu and I miss the days of the green curry dish with calamari. One more thing - the chicken corn soup that you serve at the DC Ranch location should be offered at the others as well - I love that soup!

If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.  
 
Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ....",high
I got my nails done there last Thursday for the first and last time. I would never ever go back there. The man who did my nails burnt two of my fingers really bad. The place was dirty and messy and talk about noisy he asked me to many personal questions. To top it off he answered his cell phone and talked on it about 10mins all load and on speaker phone . So rude and bad customer service. It might be a little cheaper there but as the saying goes u get what u pay for!!!!!!!,low
"Do not bother going anywhere else. This is the place to go for laser. No contracts, easy to get appointments, very reasonable. The staff is fantastic, every one of them. I usually go to Kristen, but all others are as equally friendly and competent. Location is very convenient also. I have looked, and I have received many groupon and living social offers from other places, but I never bothered. This is the one.",high
"Loved the location at atmosphere of this place!  Had a very nice business dinner here last night.  We were able to sit outside thanks to the gorgeous weather, and I'd recommend this to anyone.  The houses inside have their charm, but al fresco dining is great!  

We had a few drinks at the bar before we started dinner - they have a fairly nice wine by the glass list, as well as a nice stocked bar.  Something for everyone!

The menu contained lots of delicious choices, and it was hard to choose.  Ended up going with Hapuku, which was a new-to-me fish from New Zealand, similar to grouper.  It was delicious - tender, flaky, and the earthy vegetables with it were a nice complement.

We had very polite service, though not well-timed.  I like when plates are cleared all at once for people, instead of taking plates at the table away when others are eating.  OR, bringing the bill before we've finished dessert.  Both of these happened here.",high
I took my family here and this was a disappointin experience. The service was snobby and rude.  The waitress was condescending and the food was overprices. I have not been to the other Tomasos but I will clearly discourage anyone from dining at the Chandler Tomasos. The service is clearly substandard and snobby.,low
"Food was good. 

I had the Choppino Fruittas de Mare. Apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me, but the serving was typical for a Fruits de Mare type plate that I've had at other restaurants. Sauce was nice: spicy and good flavor. Pasta was cooked well and the right portion size, I think people add too much pasta to make the dish look larger. Other than the imitation crab (a disappointment but not a deal breaker) the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari, mussels, etc. 

Kid's spaghetti was very good. I taste all the kid's spaghetti since I have 3 kids and invariably someone doesn't finish or even start their bowl. The pasta was cooked well, the meatball was decent, but the sauce was shick and chunky (not watery which I hate) and covered all the pasta (which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to do). There isn't a specific kid's menu but the server said they make kid's portion size of anything on the menu but the price isn't available to be seen so you have to trust they aren't going to bend you over on those, which they didn't. 

Bread, of course, was available prior to meals. The butter used is very tasty, some type of garlic I think. Bread was warm, soft, and not overcooked.

Now I would have given 4 stars except for a few exceptions: the decor and slower service. 

Decor was dreadful, sorry. Old and dated. I think their target demographics is 50 years old or greater as the chairs, pictures, and everything inside screams 1970's. The chairs remind me of an old conference hall. The lighting is on the dark side. I guess if I was out on a date or with 4 retired couples, it would be a nicer decor, but with 8 adults and 5 kids it just doesn't fit quite right.

Kid friendly not quite, but kid accomidating is more like it. Since the ambience is darker and softer volume on conversations, having loud and obnoxious kids is not the right place for them.

Overall, the food is good, servers friendly but not the family friendly place I usually prefer.",low
"False ads, do not stay there. Unless you don't mind a dirty, smelly, overrated hotel. The sheets and towels that were supposed to be white were gray. The place is run down and poorly serviced. The front lobby is clean but once you head up to your room you quickly find out that the place is run down and not being taken care of. I stayed on the fifth floor ""cabana suites"" and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor, I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place. The ""suites"" were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room. The pool was NASTY! (see pictures I uploaded) It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look, it had an ""out of order"" sign placed at the entrance. This place was embarrassing! I had told my brothers to book there with me because we thought it was going to be a great hotel based on their website but we were very disappointed again!",low
"Yummy!!
Went with my best friend last night for our weekly date and had a great meal!  We enjoyed the sushi menu but everything looked quite delicious.  I LOVED the welcoming sushi chefs and beautiful aquariums.  Here is a rundown of the food...

Edamame: solid...can't really screw that one up
Philly: Great distribution of cream cheese!  I hate when sushi places over do it on the Philly...
California: Solid but could have been a bit creamer and with some spicy sauce 
Some kind of Latino roll: Skip it...weird texture inside
Scallop roll: Yummm

Great experience and so far maybe the best sushi I have come across in AZ.  I will keep you posted",high
I have liked every sub I've had there with the exception of one. Pretty good odds!,high
"I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it.

My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. It's definitely rich and gooey. 

I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place.",high
"I went here last night with my wife to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary.  We purposely arrived early to have a drink at their bar.  There wasn't much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  Champagne for her and a martini for me.  The hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  When we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble.

I made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  Upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  The host was very accommodating and gave us a better table.

The place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  The 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and I don't want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I don't know about you but I like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  The noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night.

Our waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as I would have liked.  I especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  Also, I'm not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/2 price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased.

The Food:

* Fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  They are excellent especially the truffle ones.  My only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  I would have liked them fresh but whatever.
* Wedge Salad - just ok.  The blue cheese and bacon were great though.  It just wasn't the typical steak joint wedge I am used to and was looking forward to.
* Burrata Cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good
* Truffled Mac n' Cheese - not the best I've ever had but still pretty good.  Not as thick and cheesy as I would have liked and they use weird noodles.
* Wagyu Beef Trio - My wife and I shared this.  Perfect amount for the both of us to share.  Each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  I still can't tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  The sides were also very good.  We especially liked the mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh.
* Beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  The sauces are equally awesome.

All-in-all it was a fantastic meal and great experience.  Good food, good wine, good company.  I would come back any time to enjoy a steak or one of their burgers.",low
"OK, so this is how much I love this product. I first tasted Lee's at a Yelp Elite event and waited and dreamed a whole year to eat it again. When I was invited to the next year's Elite Pleydate it was the topic of the first question out of my mouth. ""Is Lee's gonna be there?"" ( Ok, maybe the whole French restaurant's Bone Marrow gravy came to mind too, but I digress) When I made it inside to Pleydate I literally ran to that booth having desert before dinner. I am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now. The funny thing about that is I am not even a big ice cream lover. I will have to visit the shop soon.",high
"I go to Regio's a lot; today I went and want to reiterate how great I think it is.  I have been going there for a couple years - have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  Their beans are delicious, as is their menudo (only on Saturday and Sunday, unfortunately), and eveything else: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, etc, etc, etc. is great.  It is so inexpensive it's hard to believe.  Today my bff and I had 5 tacos and an order of beans (between us) and it was $10. HELLO! We had the mini-tacos, but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were.
  Check it out next time you're in the mood for some awesome, authentic Mexican food.  You will be glad you did.  Yummy.",high
"Every time I head to ABC cake supply I see this wonderful store on the way. I often say, ""I need to stop there."" Today I did. It is a wonderful ecclectic store filled with unique items. From baby, wedding, kitchen and on! I picked up some of their mini cupcake stands! LOVE!!!",high
"Mouth watering. That's all I have to say.

The food at this place is seriously amazing. Everything we tasted was better than the dish before it, and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal. The scallops were a highlight, as was the potato pie dish (that's not a very technical name for what it was, but that's my best effort). It was all very, very good, and the only thing keeping us from returning is the cost! We genuinely enjoyed our evening here, and we will absolutely go back, but it is pricey, especially for the size of the dishes.

The atmosphere and ambiance are so fun, and this place is a little dressier and trendier than some other places we've been in Scottsdale. I highly recommend this for a night out with friends, or a cool date night. It seemed as though reservations would be a good idea, although we didn't have them and were okay (it was busy, though).",high
This is probably one of my favorite spots in Oldtown.  I definitely enjoy the the Thai food here and plus the atmosphere is really chill and homey.  Service was never a problem here every time I go.  My favorite is the Basil Crispy CK....so simple to make but I love it.  Date place? Sure why not :),high
"Friendly, knowlegeable, GREAT coffee, cute place where you can everything from meetings to weddings, take a yoga class, and meet great people on Monday nights for Leashes and Lattes!",high
Very nice neighborhood spot.  The mussels are great and both pork dishes we tried were outstanding.  The Bacon-Cheddar biscuits make the meal and Fig pecan pie is the perfect finish.,high
Very average. Food was overdone and waitress stopped chomping her gum only long enough to take our order.,high
"Excellent atmosphere, eclectic menu, and reasonable prices. Welcome to The Parlor! Pizza seems to be their specialty but the menu offers so much more. Friends swear by the duck club sandwich, and my wife loves the sausage pizza. If you visit during peak times expect a wait, but head to the bar for a drink until your table is ready. Staff is super friendly- our server forgot to deliver apps we ordered and made it right by providing free apps (equal value) for our next visit. He was apologetic and owned up to the mistake (he simply forgot to add to computer) - it happens but he handled it well. I'll be back!",high
"Top notch cheesesteak. One of the best in the valley. This place has a large delivery area, and is located right by campus. The owners are really nice and friendly. I'm really glad something moved into this spot. It's so convenient. 

Their desserts are great as well. I wish they had some chicken options, but they are new and said they would be adding to the menu as time goes on. My girlfriend said the turkey sandwich was fantastic. They sometimes carry Tasty Kake, so ask about that. 

I've had the authentic cheesesteaks from Philly, and this tastes every bit as good if not better. It's definitely in my top 5 local cheesesteaks.

Edit: Just ordered delivery - Lightning fast! This place is incredibly legit. I went with a cheesesteak with White American cheese instead of ""wiz"" this time - So incredibly good. They tossed in a new dessert they didn't have last time which was awesome. 

Their prices are really good and their food is so delicious. I'm a huge fan. I'm not kidding with this 5 star rating - I love this place. Rave rave rave...",high
"I love this place.  Great food, great service from some of the nicest staff, and just a fun place to go.  It is also a place I like to meet people for happy hour.

"I was looking into gyms around the area. Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy. I asked about memberships and then he said, ""Sorry we are sold out"". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, ""Just kidding"". Trying to be a good sport I went with it. 

Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, ""Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,"". In other words, no straight answers. 

We sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. ""If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms."" ""If you choose option B, then only here"" . The whole time I could see the children's area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde routine. ""Well you only have today to make a decision, after that no price guarantee!!!""   From there he was down right rude.

I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G, I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience. Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street. They don't have the same amenities however it is locally owned, and the people are very nice there.",low

"Pho-yuck this place! 

I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese. I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house. 

The Bánh xèo was so greasy I couldn't eat it, it was literally served on a plate of grease. 

The bun was about the same. It lacked flavor, the rice noodles were slimy, the spring roll was loaded with grease. 

I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass.

The service was horrible and I will not be back.",low
"Meaty, beaty, big and bouncy!

Add ""beefy"" and you've pretty much summed up your 5GB&F  experience!

After detoxing this morning, I was really hungry...after all, I'm a pretty big and bouncy boy and when you lug this kind of tonnage up and down the canal, you're going to need some retoxing!

And since it's Taco Tuesday, I thought a burger fest sounded about right!

I needed to be up north anyway, so I texted my order (what a time and vexation saver that is!...two stars for 5GB&F right there) and it was ready, hot and juicy when I rolled in.

The burgers and fries remind me of nothing so much as Wendy's of about 30 years ago...you know, when Wendy's was actually pretty good (not like now when, they consistently screw up your order and figuratively, literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window).

The burgers are OK, the fries are fresh and peanutty (no, really...fresh peanut oil...the fries taste peanutty!), and the Coke is, well, Cokey. 

The atmosphere is nice enough, all red and white checked and tons of ""look at me"" crap on the walls (""Best Fries in Hoboken!"")

The music was also reasonably pleasant (Men at Work...""I come from a land down under""...I shuddered a little bit at the part ""and men chunder""...please, no chundering while I'm eating!).

Anyway...

I was able to purchase this little repast for a mere $11.83 (I saved a little by having the small fries).

I know, Grind or Delux prices for a retro Wendy's burger!

I'm no spendthrift, but I could feed a family of 6 at In-n-Out for $12...and with better burgers.

But, 5GB&F filled me up, they had my burger ready to roll and they very nicely didn't mess up my order (but then again, how could they screw it up...they were ordered to prepare my burger by a computer...we know what happens when you don't do what a computer tells you...you ""accidentally"" ride over a cliff on your Segway, that's what happens!)

 And, in a nostalgic sort of way, they reminded me of how Wendy's used to be (complete with 70's music), and for that, a reasonable 3.25 stars.",low
"we celebrated my birthday all weekend.  we made the trek to bobby q on sunday. I ordered the brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and let me tell you about that mac & cheese..it was amazing. Mr H went with the chicken and brisket and for his sides: beans and potato salad.  
The food is sinfully delicious! I will NOT be coming here as often as I would like... I found it too indulgent. it is definitely a treat and worth trying! I love those little donuts they give you at the end!",high
"This restaurant is in my TOP-5 favorite restaurants of all-time!  ...The only reason I am not giving it 5-stars is because it is a real splurge, and it takes a pretty special occasion (and experience) to justify such an expensive meal.

While in my personal experience at Posh, the quality (and ""deliciousness"") of the food I had definitely justifies the price-tag, it should - if the quality wasn't extraordinary, it wouldn't rank at all.

You really do have to be an open-minded, mostly omnivorous eater to fully appreciate it though.  If there are ingredients or flavors that you don't much care for, it might be more challenging to assume that you will like everything you get.  

It can be daunting, because you may get something that you don't like, but that is also part of the excitement (and the adventure of trying new things!)  You also may get something that you've never had done well before and find that you are a newly converted fan.  

Also, though the wine parings are wonderful, if you are on a budget, skipping the wine is a good way to trim the bill.

For the best experience, don't go when you are famished, and don't bring picky eaters with you - both will interfere with you having a completely satisfying experience.",high
"You'd think it would be easier to find good Chinese take-out but it's not..  Luckily, Great Wok fits the bill.  It's not super expensive, they give you a ton of food and it's really good!  I usually get the General Tso's chicken and it's hot, covered in sauce and cooked right.  The beef and broccoli is good too.  It's a typical small Chinese food joint in a strip mall so the dining room isn't anything special.  I stick with take-out.",low
"Every time going to this Best Buy I've had a good experience. The staff is extremely helpful, but not overbearing (constantly asking and asking to help like other Best Buys). They ask once, then give you your space. When you have a question, they're always nice and prompt to answer. Perfect customer service.

It gets better though. The most recent visit to this location I had bought a camera, and even with good reviews online, and the help of the BestBuy staff, I found out the audio on the camera was terrible. Just a problem with that model camera. We didn't know.

The next day I returned the camera with its plan, and had the easiest transition with customer service too get a different camera. Within 10 minutes I was in and out with a new and better camera, and didn't spend an extra dime. It was perfect, and the new camera is great! 

Just one of the many great experiences at this Best Buy. I would give this 5 stars, but the store itself is super tiny, so selection can be limited (the only drawback).",low
"This Dutch Bros had some of the best customer service I've ever seen from a young guy working on a holiday (Memorial Day). I ordered an Americano which was excellent and just the right proportions. My wife had a soy chai latte which was just a little too sweet, but still good.
Overall, it was an experience I would recommend, and it's staying on our list of go-to places as we explore our new neighborhood.",high
"Two and a half stars, really. 

This place is really quite strange. Video coffee bar? I don't have much to compare it to, I guess.

We'll start with the coffee: traditional espresso macchiato. No microfoam, large bubbles in the milk, too hot to drink right away. The shot was good, but by the time it was cool enough to drink had lost quite a bit of flavor.

Very friendly service, on the other hand. Given that Phoenix-foam tends to be subpar, I tend to think that service and atmosphere are almost more viable measures for successful coffeeshops than coffee. (in Phoenix) 

The actual place was pretty odd. Large paintings of Mexican sugar skulls in the back, nice chairs and tables, an orange faux-finish on the walls... And then the video bar element. Three huge flatscreens on the wall playing pop music videos from the '90s. Very strange, in my opinion. I'm not sure that Cher and Madonna really mesh with coffee shop, but I guess they're trying something new. 

I had a nice time lounging and it was relatively quiet with regularly good lighting.",high
"A clean shopping center with many classy options for food, drink and retail therapy.",high
"Excellent in every way.  Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night - GREAT live music, excellent wine selection.   Keeping Fountain Hills young.... one weekend at a time.",high
"I actually have grown to love this little place. Their coffee is good; their breakfast burritos are absolute heaven. Made with provolone cheese, these burritos have a more mellow and sophisticated taste than the average breakfast burrito you'll find drowned in yellow cheese.

You can get a Big Ass Burrito, or a Half Ass Burrito. Personally, I don't like to do anything ""half-assed"", so I opt for the Big Ass Burrito that, although adds circumference to MY big ass, is soooo worth it in the morning when you want a laid back spot to enjoy your meal and coffee (go for the iced).

They also have an art exhibit /sale right now for the month of September with awesome aviation pictures printed on canvas. Amazing art to enjoy as you sip your coffee.",high
"PCG is the restaurant by which I judge all others. PCG is totally dependable, always excellent. Service is always good, food excellent. i have eaten here probably 20 times and have never had a bad meal.

"Great great great tacos!
I go to a restaurant for the food first.  As long as it is clean, and Lulu's is, then sitting in, what looks like a used McDonalds booth, doesn't bother me a bit.  Afterall, it's a taco shop!
I like the fish tacos (the small ones) and I usually order 3 of them.  I like how they are made and it reminds me of what you can normally find in Mexico, not at these chain restaurants.
The Ceviche tostada is really good too, but is difficult to eat, so don't wear your sunday best.
Not in the mood for fish, then try the carne asada tacos or any other kind for that matter.

Lulu's is a great place and a break from the Americanized Mexican Food, we see everyday.

My only recommendation would be to order it dry, with the sauce on the side.  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.

We got shoes in our size then went and picked out a ball. Lots to choose from! Lots of fun!!!   It was a $20.00 night for 2 of us. The workers are very helpful and Friendly.

Ambiance: Thinking about redecorating the house to look just like Trader Vic's - unbelievable.

Appetizer: Beef Cho-Cho - amazingly tender, it melts in your mouth. Great flavor.
Dinner: Trader Vic's Calcutta Curries: good & better when you mix in the variety of garnishes.  fun to play around with the flavors.

"I have to give major kudos to our server here. We rolled up at 9p per the Yelp listing happy hour times. Come to find out that 9 is the weekday happy hour and Fri/Sat's happy hour doesn't start until 10. We we're okay with this but our server spoke to the manager without us even complaining or asking him to and honored the 9p happy hour because of the Yelp listing. 

Now to the food and drink. 
If you love cheese, their cheese menu was very large. We got several of the cheeses, the Tres Freres was my favorite (non-happy hour item though). The pork empanadas are a must and the happy hour drinks were very good as well. The strawberry sunset martini was very yummy. 

I'd say the happy hour items are where it's at overall. The food was great the drinks were good. Really given their menu and atmosphere I was really surprised that it wasn't more busy. It's kind of sad to see many of the Phoenix area restaurants kind of dead at 9pm on a Friday night. I'm guessing if it were located in Scottsdale that would be a different story.",low
"Oh god. It's like GOD'S VERY OWN HOT POCKET. Fresh, delicious, and cooked perfectly, though I have trouble bringing myself to get anything but The Pilgrim (served with turkey, cubed sweet potatoes, onions, and deliciousness). Cornish Pasty is great, though you'll likely want to consider takeout: it's TINY and finding a table can be a real pain.

The staff is fun and helpful, even though they're quite harried, and the oven-roasted potatoes are fantastic, as are nearly all of the pasty options, all priced damn well, to boot. If you've never been, they'll almost certainly have something you like. My only problem is that nothing is customizable: they're all served as is, which I understand from a production standpoint, but which frustrates for the number of menu items with just one dealbreaking ingredient for me.

Overall, it's exceedingly easy to be a regular, and to feel VERY full, careful not to eat the crimped part of the pasty, just like the tin miners of yore so as to avoid the traces of arsenic from their dirty hands.",low
"Private Karaoke at Geisha A Go Go is the coolest thing to hit Old Town in a while!!   My girlfriends and I went this weekend and it was incredible. I have heard a lot about karaoke being the new trend but not until I actually experienced it for myself did I understand why, until now. We had a private room with a flat screen TV and drinks at the flip of a switch (um, can you say bachelorette party?!).  It was so nice to have a night out without actually having to wait for drinks at a crowded bar or being able to hang out with your friends without random guys interrupting with a cheesy line to try to talk to you. It was $75 for an hour in a private room with 10 of my best friends. And by the time you split that between everyone it was well worth the extra expense. 

Seriously once you try it you will be hooked too! I can't wait to go back!",high

"I wish I could love this place... It's just tough. 
I've eaten here several times and just haven't really LOVED anything. My sandwiches have always been dry and kind of bland tasting. Salads have been ok, but I usually feel like I can make them better. Hummus - dry. Dolmades - tasted like the ones from the jar. Ahh, so sad, because it's food that I do normally love. 
Here is why I gave this a three- happy hour prices are good ($2 or $3 for small plates). With prices like that, I can forgive some of the food quality a bit.",high
"It's 4:00 am on a Friday, you've just finished listening to awesome music and drinking too much, you're starving and want some good comfort food to fill your gut and soak up that alcohol..... enter Jerry's.

The place was open.  The place was clean.  The food was good.  The service was great.  The prices were great.  WAY better than a Denny's, better than most diner's I've been to, actually.

I had ham and eggs and the plate was delicious.  The ham steak was gigantic, the eggs perfect, and hash browns were done just right... crispy and good.",high

"Called last night @ 4:30 and tried to do call ahead seating for 6:30 for a party of 9. We are in town and are here to see some friends. Explained to hostess that some in the group are seniors so would need to have assurance on reservation. I was told to call back in an hour, the thought process by her was that it was too soon to give me a time and they weren't that busy yet. So I did as told and called back and after about 10 minutes of confusion and other waiting I was told we couldn't be seated until 7:30 or we could have seperate booths. I explained that we needed to sit together and 2 hours was the best she could do. I was so frustrated I told her no thanks that we would find other arrangements. She said ok and that was it. Nice job Texas Roadhouse. NOT!!! There is no excuse for not having a reservation system in place, like Open Table. One day there will be no customers to disappoint, then maybe you will get it.",low

One Kids Burger with Apple Slices (Nope) one side of hummus(Nope) But they are quick to charge you for the order. Then you call and talk to a girl name Liz and she begins to tell you that they are correct and you the customer are wrong. Even though I have all the food sitting in front of me nope still no kids burger or side of hummus. HMMMMM,.. keep letting her answer the phone and you will see your to go customer base decline. We are an office in Scottsdale that everyday is ordering lunch for the office, Daphnes has officially been removed from the menu book.

Nice customer service!!!!!!",low
"Pretty good food.  The location is kind of scary, for a famous place.  i was a little disappointed in their lunch menu.  i am not a fan of paying $12 for a lunch plate.  i don't need 10 lbs of food at lunch time, but a nice $4-5 plate of food at lunch would be great.  I might return by myself, because the food is very spicy, and most people i hang out with don't like that.  it was even spicy for me and i don't mind that too much.",low
"One thing is for sure:  You will be full when you leave Harlow's.  I think that the huevos are pretty good, but the biscuits and gravy leave a little to be desired, or so say the meat eating friends of mine.  To be fair, this was in comparison to my very amazing freshly made biscuits and veggie gravy (biscuit recipe credit to Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything).

It is a decent people watching locale on the weekends as long as you can stand to wait out in the parking lot until they call your party inside.",high
The food was what one would expect from the outside. Mel's is not a hole in the wall place with amazing food. It's diner with decent food for decent prices. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.

"El Taco de Chandler exceeded my expectations.  I've driven past it almost every day for a year.  My curiosity finally got to me, so my boyfriend and I went in to try the food.  We waited quite a few minutes (easily 10 to 15) for our order, which is a good sign for fresh preparations.  The joint is hooked up with a juke box, pool table, dining area with tables and chairs, and two benches near the register, for those waiting to take their food home.  There were special desserts in a glass display cabinet, including coconut clusters and sweets I've seen in Mexico.  The assortment of beverages is outstanding, offering both Coke and Pepsi products, juices, CapriSun, horchata, beer, and Sunny Delight!  The menu is about par for Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, in terms of content and price.  I got a fish taco, which was outstanding!  No cheap tartar sauce here!  I also got a cheese quesadilla, which came garnished with lettuce and tomato slices.  The quesadilla was warm and fresh, on an obviously fresh tortilla filled with tasty cheese.  For the two of us to eat a few a la carte items from the menu, the total came to $11.00.  There are also combination plates available, as well as quite a few soups.  Overall, I was very impressed!  This looks like a fun place to hang out.  The food is definitely worth the wait.  I happened to ask the cashier, and they are open until 10pm on Saturday's.  Muy delicious!",high
This place was messy and loud.  The food really wasn't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together.  Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food.  I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me,low
"The first thing to know about this Los Reyes location is that it is quite different from the one on 7th St!  It's a different menu here, for starters!  I had my heart set on my usual, a ""Torta Norteña, & a 99 cent Ceviché.  They don't have those things here, so I settled for the nearest looking sandwich, a ""Mexican Torta"".  (My server did say the ownership is the same as the Sunnyslope location.)  Anyhow, here's how it was for me here today:

*  This is a good sized place, & I managed to find both a parking space & a comfortable table inside to land at, even though they were ROARING BUSY!

*  My nice server almost immediately brought me a big basket of tortilla chips & two kinds of salsa, medium & hot!  Both were good.  (They don't even serve tortilla chips at Sunnyslope.)

*  I ordered, & it took a little while for my sandwich to arrive, but as I said, they were super busy!  No problemo.  Meanwhile, I ate about half of my chips, & Señorita brought me ANOTHER big basket of them, & more salsa!

*  My torta arrived, & it was BIG & DELICIOUS!  It comes with a side salad, which included some pimento & cucumber slices, lime halves, lettuce, & a fried quarter onion.  All this was good too (&  DID remind me of the other location).

*  Gripes?  THREE TVs blabbing out a show in Spanish, fairly loud, & this place was noisy to begin with.

SO?  ...I didn't care as much for the menu here as Sunnyslope, & the TVs were a bit of a nuisance, but with that said, I still think this is an very good place to eat, & the value was AMAZING at only $6.50 for everything!     :-))",high
"I honestly feel a bit bad giving Wildflower a three star rating, but I'm honestly waiting for the time when I feel impressed with their food. 

I've been to Wildflower quite a few times, ordering something different each time. First time was the sweet potato and fig sandwich. Disaster. Next time with the BLT plus. Ick. Next time was Potato Soup. Eh. I don't know what my problem is, everyone raves about this place as being awesome. 

The nice thing about this location is that I can meet friends here for a mediocre lunch and walk to the movie theatre or Target afterwords.",high
"Joe's is a Gilbert staple. They have the service down to a science so you can start your journey standing in the back of a line that is about a quarter mile long, and inside of 5 minutes you are sitting at a picnic table under the trees enjoying your grub.

I have been a fan since before I knew why it was important to find and keep places like this thriving.  Joe is cool, and a guy that people who want to succeed in independant business in Arizona should keep their eye on. 

The food is quality, the location has been around forever, but keeps fresh with awesome and unique decor (like a life size tractor) and lots of space outside for families with kids to go crazy.

The menu is simple and doesn't try to do too much. The staff is usually very pleasant as well. 

My usual is that potato that is as big as my forearm stuffed to the gills with pulled pork, sour cream, chives, bbq sauce, butter, cheese.

The room is cozy, and a decent size. The king size bed was comfy with fluffy pillows. The living room had plenty of seats that faced the flat screen TV. The room has a mini-fridge and a microwave.

The only gripe about this place is a very small closet and bathroom. There is barely enough room to close the door for the bathroom. The closet also had one sliding door. 

The continental breakfast was average. No hot food. Guests can choose either cold cereal, instant oatmeal, juice and milk, fruit, yogurt, toasts or bagels. The seating area in the kitchen was convenient for guests to enjoy their meal.

If you need access to computers, they are located next to the kitchen. There is a printer as well.",high
"After repeat visits it just gets worse - the service, that is.  It was as if we were held hostage and could not leave for a full 25 minutes because that's how long it took to receive hour check after several requests to several different employees.  Female servers might be somewhat cute but know absolutely nothing about beer and this is a brewpub.  I asked if they have an seasonal beers and the reply was no, that they only sell their own beers!  Even more amusing is their ""industrial pale ale"" is an IPA but it is not bitter.  So, they say it's an IPA but it's not bitter, it's not a true-to-style IPA.  Then people say ""Oh I don't like IPA's"" and want something else.  Their attempt to rename a beer/style is actually hurting them.  Amazing.

The menu was not the regular menu, just a small list of about 4-5 choices.  To make it worse, the actual menu on every table was wrong, yet the kept the menus on the tables anyway.  I heard 3 separate tables order the fried raviolis but they did not have them.  

This place is *only* in business because of the location, location, location.",low
"This is a very pretty and very chic looking restaurant, and I hoped that the food was as good as the decor.  My friend and I had the sangria and the mojito, and then we shared a bruschetta and the garlic pizza.

I found the sangria a little on the acidic side, but drinkable, and it was fortified with something, because it was a lot stronger than it tasted.  My friend's mojito was good.

I LOVED the bruschetta. Not only were the toppings well-planned and delicious, but the bread had a nice crunch and a slightly smoky fire-baked taste to it. Ditto for the pizza, in which the crust shared the stage with the toppings.  Don't expect cheese-red sauce-and-pepperoni type pizzas, as you might expect from the look of the place, the pizza is artisianal.

Nearly half the seating is out on the patio, and one unusual feature is that the seats were low and the tables as well.  This makes it a good place to relax with your friends (as you feel like you're sitting on patio furniture) but harder to eat your food.

We had good service the night we went (a weeknight, around 8:30).  Zero wait for our table, and prompt, polite service.  I would definitely go here again.",low
"Oh Mojo you won my heart from day one... I always thought I was a gelato spot kinda guy but no apparently I can swing both ways.

"Made the mistake of eating here on 10/24. Hostess and maitre de set the tone wrong with their completely haughty and unwelcoming approach when we arrived. Acted like they were doing us a big favor by letting us eat there. 

Wine list is extensive but outrageously overpriced. We selected a good bottle (90 points WS) and when we asked the self-labeled ""wine guy"" about it, he said, ""I actually can drink that."" A snobby comment. 

Food was completely uninspired and pedestrian. Nothing special here. 

Service fair, pace was bad between courses - long waits. 

Had a meal the night before at T Cooks -it was extremely better in every single category. Lon's gets by on it's nice patio setting. The food is average at best. Go to T Cooks instead.

If you do go here, call long ahead and at least get a decent table on the patio.",low
"Here is the thing about JoJo's, its in a neighbor were you eat at chain joints or you cook at home. It seemed like a safe bet, and who doesn't want to support their neighborhood pizza place?

They started off on the wrong foot with me by not accepting their free pizza coupon they had sent me in the mail. I had called before hand and asked if it was valid, was told it was, and then was not given a free pizza. Instead, I was given a discount on another pizza. So, instead of coming home with two, which was the plan, I got one for cheap. I didn't want one for cheap. I wanted two. 

The food itself is typical. The crust, cheese and toppings are average, sloppy in a bad way. The sauce is a bit to sweet for my liking, but having eaten here twice, has tasted different each time. The service was alright, delivery took about an hour on a Friday. 

The rest of the menu, aside from the pizza, is what you would imagine. Wings (not remarkable), fried items and some sandwiches. 

Lets put it this way, if I was at someone's house and they ordered a pie from JoJo's, I would eat it. However, I wouldn't purchase one again myself.",high
"While I love that it is Native American owned and operated, the best thing about this restaurant is the food - as it should be.  I don't go out to eat to be entertained or charmed - just fed better than I could be at home and that is exactly what this place does.  

The food is amazing. The fry bread isn't greasy and I don't know how they do that.  The meals are flavorful, filling, and reasonably priced.  The only thing I would do is add some tomatoes to the tacos but that is a minor quibble.  

If you want to go out for a delicious meal in a casual place and not pay a lot for it, GO NOW to the Fry Bread House.",high

"Happy Hour Review.

We stopped by to try the much ballyhooed Happy Hour and were were pretty damn underwhelmed.    First of all, I guess I'm failing to see what's so happy about a $6.00 spicy tuna roll and $8.00 drink.  Secondly, like other non-japanese sushi joints in this town (cough, cough Ra Sushi), this is sushi for people who don't really like sushi.  Thirdly, seriously attitudinous staff, but one look at the uber-douchy clientele explains that.  Pass.",high

happy hour is LOUD in the bar. not fun loud, but ""let's crank the bad early 90s alt rock and top 40 emo rock as loud as possible"" seemingly as catch all for the only demographics who will like this place- early 20s and late 40s and 50s who want to seem like they still know how to get down with the younger generation.

because it's ahwatukee (a ""sleepy bedroom"" community that is pretty affluent all in all and likes to be reminded), the crowd can be obnoxious, even more than this bar already is.

again, i recommend it as a place to go and be rowdy, not to eat great sushi.",high
"Nice ambiance, nice authentic spicy chinese food.  
As good as you can get here in Arizona;  it aint L.A or San Fran, but does a good job to satisfy the craving for real chinese.
 
Of all the Cofco asian restaurants, this is one of the more presentable ones to bring business clients or a new date, if ambiance is key to scoring positive brownie points.    
 
For some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasn't for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week. 
Asian woman orders from real chinese menu;  her white guy orders from chow mein menu.
 
Side note:  Get a grip; asian women check each other out, and  usually not in a nice way--like in a sizing you up-comparing you to herself way--so I usually end up losing my appetite when I catch one of them staring at me (and my man) and whispering to her white guy or her girlfriends about me;  yah, I understand the shit you say about me, asian girls, because I speak your language too, hello!
 
So I compensate for my chinese food cravings by quick carry out.  Works like a charm every time.  I'm happy, my own Cracker is happy.  Owner gets lots of business and is happy. 
 
We all win.",high
"No offense to everyone who gave this place 5 stars, but the Tempe Cinema staff needs a swift kick in the ass. During school hours, this place is regularly crawling with hooligan truants. Maybe those who run this theatre want to ensure they will have a steady stream of staffing options from the dropouts who use it as a hideout. Losers.",low
"They have anything from salads, pitas, wraps, burgers, and wood fired pizzas.  Although this isn't a 100% plant-based restaurant they pride themselves on having many vegan options.  Not only are there options, but upon visiting their site I found a table of what items are vegan, what aren't, and what makes them non-vegan (which is always nice to know). Great to have so many vegan options that are spelled out on their website.  

We expected a counter-service experience but were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find it was an actual sit-down restaurant.  The vibe was a classy yet laid back, youthful feel.  Most of the servers were high school or college age and wore regular street clothes (think Urban Outfitters style).  I loved the laid back atmosphere of the servers even though it's a sit-down experience and really enjoyed the color scheme and tin plated ceiling.

The food was absolutely FANTASTIC.  Oh my. For an appetizer we selected the garlic dip with two pitas.  The garlic dip is a mix of olive oil, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and smashed potatoes.  If you love garlic, you'll love this.

My husband chose the Falafel Pita which was topped with cilantro and spices, mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tahini.  He was very happy with his choice, although next time he'd ask for no onions.

I went with the Veggie Garden Wrap that included zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, yellow squash, carrots, onions, tomatoes, brown rice, mixed beans, ginger, herbs and garlic.

One thing we quickly found was that our entrees were HUGE.  This is not a complaint in anyway.  However, next go around we may share an entree.  Either way, this visit, we had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day.

 Will definitely return.",high
"Great sandwiches at reasonable prices. The bread is good, the au jus was flavorful and not too salty, and the sausages are made daily.  It was nice to find a place to get great sandwiches.

Falaffel appetizer was nice, but Falaffel itself was too finely ground and flavorless.  Salads were really outstanding.  Enchiladas, also, were very good.  Thai short ribs were pretty good as well.  Great dessert options.  Overall pricey, but fair.",high
This weekend was my first time back since they have done the huge remodel and under new ownership. This place still has the same comfort feel to it and is cozy. Havent tried the food yet but enjoyed the drinks and the ambience in the bar. Hopefully the food is better than what it used to be.,high
"I can't say enough good things about this place. 

Quick disclosure: When I was working for the Downtown YMCA, I discovered Local Breeze as I was searching for businesses to participate in our fund-raising campaign. Local Breeze was totally down to contribute. So on top of getting that delicious meal, know that your money is largely going back to the community. Awesome.

But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back. The coca-cola ham is delish, and the serving sizes are pretty decent. You definitely get your money's worth. And there's a reason why my profile says that my ""recent discovery"" is ""spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze."" That was written months ago, but I don't think I've discovered anything quite as amazing yet. And I normally don't even like cottage cheese.

The last time I went was for my bday dinner, and again, it didn't let me down. We had good food, good drinks, and a good time in general. The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini, which sounds weird, but if you're a martini fan, go for it. If you're feeling less risky, you can't go wrong with their mojito.",high
Good & fast food. Prices are fair. They charge a fee for Bank cards.,high
"From my door, it's a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to Dukes. They have a nice patio. They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games. They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet, I've only been to Duke's a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad.

Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on ""special.""

The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good. Everything seems to be made from ""freezer to fryer"" or packaged products. I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.

One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. He'll ask patrons ""how is everything?"" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesn't matter.

In this city, sports bars are a dime a dozen. I'd rather go elsewhere.",low
"I went to the one in Mesa on Baseline. I loved the vibe, service, and decor. They have witty jokes on the walls and the whole place makes you feel like you are at a party on the beach. We ordered the carne asada burrito and the mushroom burger and the sweet potato fries. We got the dessert pear and blackberry lemonades. You get 1 free refill so we tried the blood orange and the guava flavors after. Everything tasted great. I would def go back and get the mushroom burger. The prices are super cheap and the portions are huge.",low
"I feel bad for this park. Its nice. Really nice. The only problem is its in Phoenix where it is hot like heck. That means the roof is always closed. And with the roof closed, it almost feels like you are watching baseball inside of an auditorium.",high
"OK, being from Wisconsin (the land of the ""great lakes"") I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that, yes, there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona.  The Lake, Saguaro Lake, is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dam...even so, its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest.  I was amazed, frankly, at how beautiful this tour was.  Sold for $18 for 90 minutes, you get your money's worth.  But that is probably not what you want to hear...

The ""event"" is a combination of 1) the scenery, and also 2) the charm of the paddle boat itself.  The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 75 people!  It's an event that you could share with family, but I happened to be there with friends.  Currently, it's a pretty mellow type of event (great for Mother's Day!), although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows, Jazz ensembles, stargazing, and a variety of other events.

P.S.  They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics, weddings, and the like.",high
"I stayed here last month. It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. 

The room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.

FYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.

My main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.

I guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities. But, if I could find another hotel close by with a similar price, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere else.",high
"The food is good and the location is perfect. A solid breakfast spot in Oldtown. Everything on the menu looks fantastic. I went the healthy route this morning and went with the Quick Start Conscious. 4 egg whites, broccoli, tomato, fruit and cottage cheese. Phenomenal for a healthy breakfast out.   Breakfast club also brews a pretty solid cup of coffee that gives me a pretty good buzz for only having two cups.

The only real negative is the outside seating. It seemed good in theory on a cool day in Scottsdale with temperatures only in the seventies. However, being right on Scottsdale Road, it was hard to hear the people I was eating with because of all the passing traffic. I'd advise that anyone dining here eat inside (where it unfortunately can also be a little loud since the place is always busy).",high
"I really enjoyed my mani/pedi with Trisha!  She took her time and taught me about manicuring my nails from home which I loved.

I went in for the Groupon basic mani/pedi deal and left feeling like I got a lot more! It was the most pleasant experience I've had at a nail salon. The conversation was easy and Trish is a great person. I will be coming back to Trish for nails again! 

The entire staff was friendly and professional. Great Salon!!",high
"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best BBQ I've had in Arizona.

"Great little restaurant.  The staff is super friendly, and their happy hour specials are pretty amazing.  I got thePanko crusted Tipalia which was a little dry, but my girlfriend's stuffed mahi mahi was delicious.  The Horchata bread pudding was really good too.  They have a nice patio where most of the customers sit, I will be bringing my dog with me next time.  

It is a bit expensive, so be prepared to drop some money, but it's definitely worth checking out.",high
"I stayed at the Firesky Resort before taking my MCAT and have mixed feelings about my stay. Now granted, I had extremely high anxiety at the time so perhaps I didn't get to see the full glory of this place, but in my opinion it is somewhat overrated. For the price I paid, I expected more. 

The resort layout is more like a fantastically designed apartment complex. In fact, I am pretty sure that it was an apartment complex prior to being a resort. With that said, however, the lobby and grounds are absolutely phenomenal. They are stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious. 

My room was a little bit less impressive though. It had most of the amenities that I expected, but nothing extra. The artwork wasn't overly impressive and the linens were just average. Also, the TV was small. It certainly wasn't nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort.

The deck/balcony area was very nice though and I was able to study in the fresh air without any distractions.

If you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything, the Firesky fits the bill. However, don't expect to be wowed by your room. It is an average room. Nothing less, nothing more.",high
"Lived in house for 9 years and just thought was time to replace the carpeting, had used some of those ""$99 room"" services over the years for routine cleaning, met Ray Odom, Owner of Hydro-Pro, and gave them a crack at cleaning the carpets before I replaced them. I was Amazed at results, by the time they were done the carpets looked brand new, took their time and did incredibally throrugh job.  Great service at reasonable price-well worth it. My carpet cleaner from now on.",high
"Update: As of Feb 2010 this place closed because the owners got in a bitch fight.

I live right next door to this place at Shade.  I go often enough, great happy hour.  Prices are pretty cheap ($5ish for the various happy hour sushi rolls), service is pretty fast, and it's great that it's locally owned and not a chain restaurant.  

Only ""negative"" comment is it' is a bit small inside, hard to accommodate large groups of more than 8, and even that is pushing it if they are busy.  If you can go before everyone gets off work, it's pretty quiet in there, and fun to sit at the sushi bar as well.",high
"Visited recently for the first time.  Enjoyed happy hour appetizers on the patio.  Cool place for outdoor dining, the waterfall added a nice background.  They offer smoking and non-smoking on separate sides of the patio.  Of course you know that if anyone is smoking, the entire area gets to ""enjoy"" the smoke.  Being a non-smoker, I would appreciate an true non-smoking area but being outdoors was too compelling to pass on this beautiful day.  Another small observation - the tables were too low for the chairs causing you to lean over to eat and the chairs were not comfortable at all.  

We ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer.  The quesadilla was made w/ green chiles and cheese, served w/ green & red salsa.  Didn't care for the red salsa but the green was pretty good, rather mild.  A side of sour cream was all that was missing here.  Crab cakes were ok, nothing special.  Served w/ a nice side salad it made a very good small meal.  A side of some kind of orange sauce (chipotle?) for the crab cakes that seemed really HOT to me - skip this next time please.

Just based on the outdoor atmosphere alone, I would definitely come back again.",high
"Its haunted! Isn't that enough to get everyone to go check out Casey Moore's?  Who doesn't like Casper?!

Such a great compromise... you are still right around Mill Ave and if you are an ASU student this is quite convenient.  However, Casey's is not part of the typical 'Mill Ave' meat-market scene.  Always is a whole slew of people from old timers, to angstful hipster, to stoic gothic, to average joe.  

Drinks are reasonably price with a great late night happy hour.  Food is fantastic... the oysters really live up to the name 'Casey Moore's Oyster House'... besides they are supposed to be an aphrodisiac so bring your dates ;)  

Lots of outdoor seating (picnic benches) so you can cram people at tables.  The interior is as divey as you are going to get in Tempe ... so I'll take it. 

Only downside is unreliable service.. its been quite hit or miss as far as the bartenders go... but the bouncers/ID checkers are undoubtedly hilarious everytime!",high
"I will agree with the others that it is a cheap sushi option.  But I wasn't impressed.  The sashimi was precut, tasteless and soggy (like it was just defrosted).  Also, I saw that they had pre-made rolls on the back counter.  Come on, how hard is it to make a fresh roll?

I would have given them 1 star but we did get free miso and salad and I didn't get sick from the fish.  We got what we paid for.",high
"On a Friday night restaurant was busy, but the service was top drawer. Food was very good and we will be back. Prices reasonable.",high
"This place is a gem. The food is amazing. It's cheap. The service is good. My favorite part? The place never changes. I can walk through the door and Ali already knows my order. The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their hand-made pita - so soft and delicious. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce. I've never found better hummus in my life. I've had it all around town, in New York, in L.A. (ick...L.A. *shudder*). SO good! The iced tea has a hint of rose water. OH and the gyro? Hands down, the best in town.

Did I mention they have a market attached? Talk about the best price on spices in town! The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows, so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up!

I couldn't get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue. I am no connoisseur of organ meats, but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb you've ever had in your life. Shut up and try it.

The only sad part about Haji's is that they close early. Usually 8pm on a week-night, but totally worth getting to-go orders if you can swing in on your way home from work!",high
"A  bit surprised at the high prices but figured that the ""trendy factor in old town"" and the atmosphere was the reason because the teeny portions of the food and the quality is just GOOD, like the Good egg, not great, not bad, just good. 
No happy hour?
And Too dark inside. 
Lots of pretty wait staff. 
My first suggestion would be to fire grill the mahi tacos and not batter them, they were not that flavorful. The side dishes of street corn and some potato chorizo thing were very good. I wanted to try the guac, but 12 bucks for an avacado with some garlic and cilantro? How about trying to make a good ceviche?

My hubby and i thought that Rubios rocks in comparison, we love the shrimp tacos and the pablano and portobello tacos.",high

I highly recommend this place I live in California and this place still comes to mind. Great for college students and the fam bam.",high
"I had my first meal at Miele's last night, and was pleasantly surprised.  I purchased a Groupon to the restaurant a month or so ago, and am glad that I did because otherwise may not have noticed this cute place amongst it's neighbors in the strip mall.

We started with the brochette, and spent the next 10 minutes raving about how amazing it was.  The tomatoes were crisp and fresh, the chopped garlic was very complimentary, and the oil had a fantastic flavor.  Definitely a good choice.  For dinner I had the spaghetti and meatballs and my boy had the chicken toscana.  Both had a very authentic Italian flavor that accompanies food made with care.  The meatballs were everything I was craving...a little spicy and filled with flavor.  My portion left enough for leftovers, but Brent ate his entire meal.  We both left with a full belly and intentions to return again soon.

I have no complaints about the food (delicious!), but docked the restaurant a star for two reasons:

1. The lights are way too bright.  While I appreciate that the restaurant is more casual than some Italian joints I've been to, a dimmer switch on the overhead lights could do wonders for the atmosphere!

2.  One of my favorite treats at Italian restaurants is bread dipped in tasty olive oil with fresh ground pepper and Parmesan cheese.  The bread is delicious, but the prepackaged butter that accompanied it didn't impress me.  I also would have liked freshly ground Parmesan on my spaghetti.

We noticed a lot of pizzas being picked up for takeout, and both thought the bar looked like a cute little place to come have a drink and a bite sometime.

Highly recommended and a great way to support a local business owner in Tempe!",high
"Uh-oh. Where am I? 

The view from atop the mountain is superb. The city can be seen in all directions. Look, there's Downtown 1 and Downtown 2. And a bunch of houses under construction. And look at that sky. Wowza. 

Ok, so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing. Stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another. ""Don't worry,"" I told my friend. ""This city is laid out in a grid. If anything, we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street."" Oh, little did I know. 

Let me give you the back story. I've been to South Mountain twice. The first time was Christmas Eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found. I met a friend there and we blazed our own trail. He always had his jeep in sight, so no harm in getting turned around. I trusted him to be my guide. 

The second and last time I hiked South Mountain was in February. My best friend flew in to Phoenix for the weekend (for my birthday) and since the weather was so great (in comparison to Detroit), she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible. No problem. I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know we'd get lost. 

We parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. ""Onward!"" we shouted, punching the air with our fists. 

A little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldn't call us ""lost,"" as this point in time, but that's only because I'm too stubborn to admit such an error. ""Let's ask somebody,"" I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, ""Will this trail loop back around?"" ""Where do you want to go?"" he asked. That's when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that. 

We pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F.

We set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste. 

Having hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. ""Let's hitch a ride,"" I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves. 

That's when a car slowed down. ""Ugh, creep,"" I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, ""We can take him."" After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway. 

We chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? That's when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically. 

The kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, nature's beast and practical joker. 

We counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement. Lucky for us, we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment; otherwise, I may never have made it home to write this review.",high
"HARISSA SPICED FRIES. Need I say more? The wine list is exceptional, and they are open late, both of which are mandatory if you're a boozy creature of the night like me.

Our server was quite attentive without being intrusive. Our wine glasses were never dry, and she instinctively sensed that it would be a three bottle sort of night and suggested additional bottles to go with our meal.

The food was of a generous proportion, so bear this in mind when ordering. My Fez Salad was fresh, crisp, and the combination of the dressing and goat cheese hit the spot. Our hummus platter was heaven-sent, and had just the right amount of garlic. The lamb kisra was also exceptional, and immediately devoured. The aforementioned Harissa fries were fiery and I often dream of them. No, really. If Fez was located in Tucson, I would gain at least ten pounds from just eating harissa fries every day. Harissa, for those of you who are unfamiliar, is a North African chili-based spice that has a lovely smoky quality. I highly recommend it!

Well, Fez. I'm in Phoenix next weekend. Prepare yourself for round two.",high

"Ok here goes.  I'll start with the bad and finish positive.  As far as Pizza goes, which is what we went for, I was not that impressed.  I must say I'm more of a NY style, by the slice pizza kind of guy.  So the pizza did not hit the spot.  Maybe a little too fancy for my palette. (You can take a boy out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of the boy, so for me simple food is always better.)  Obviously, there are enough people who like gourmet pizza as this place has amazing reviews, so I'm just one simple man.

The obnoxious fat chick sitting right behind me proclaimed to her friend, ""I'm no longer investing time in men who aren't available!""  Put down the pizza and grab a dry salad and shut up!!  That's not really the restaurants fault though but I did have to endure that convo through the duration of my meal.

Our server was very nice however seemed very rushed and at times we had to wait for refills on water and for the check.  The atmosphere is very romantic outside with light trees and live music.  They even turned on one of the heaters on the patio for the lil lady.  We has the Crepe with Nutella chocolate powdered sugar and ice cream and it was very very good.  

Bottom line.  I'd be willing to come here again and try something other than pizza.",high
"""trendy, loud-music, ok-sushi!"" - 2/5

When we lived right across the street from the Sushi Brokers, J and I used to go there at least once a month for its happy hour. We probably had been there at least 8 times with friends and family.

"Some might say that Phoenix is a city without much culture.  That may be true in some aspect, however we have to remember that Phoenix is a young large city compared to other cities that lie within the United States.  So you can say that this city is a work in progress on catching up with everyone's culture expectations.

The Japanese Friendship Garden in downtown Phoenix is only seven years old.  Very new to the park scene for this metro, I have to say that it looks great and will only keep getting better in time.  That will happen if people stop saying there is no culture in Phoenix and become a part of the evolving city by visiting places such as this.  The admission and or donations will fund a more desired park for all.

The grounds of the garden are very beautiful with a nice flowing stream, several waterfalls, coy fish, and many species of plants.  I can't wait to go back in the next several years to see it become a wonderful masterpiece.",high

"First thing - I felt compelled to write a review because the Android and Ipad app both state that Mokis is closed. If you are doing a mobile Yelp for this place, it is most defiantly open.

Second, I decided to give them a try for an early Friday dinner, about 5 in the evening. There were a few people dining in the restaurant, and quite a few people on staff for the evening. The dining room is pretty well decorated, more so than I thought it would be, giving a faux Hawaiian feel to it. Seeing some people there at that time gave me hope for a good meal.

I asked the lady manning the counter what was good, and she took a bit of time to walk me through the menu. Emphasizing the plate lunches, I decided to try the Combo that would get me the most variety. I elected for terriyaki beef and kalua pork. I took the side of the 'potato mac' and got my meal to go.

Arriving home, my meal sat for about 5 minutes before I had it unboxed and ready to enjoy. Considering that fact, everything was in pretty good condition. The potato mac was a bit more room temperature than cold, but that was my own doing. The rice stayed warm, the pork moist and really flavorful, and the beef sweet and tender.

Having dined at a few places offering plate lunches in the past, the potato mac was probably what sold me as much as the meats on why I'll return. Potato mac's tend to have a pretty flat flavor, and when I find out how Hawaiian's garnish them, I will be excited to get some more flavor in them. But it was just the right amount of dry ... I've had many potato mac's that are just too wet, but this felt about perfect.

I'll give the fish dishes a try in the future and report on those. But I really enjoyed what I experienced and well give it a second (and probably more) pass.",high

"If you don't love Guissepe's, you don't love Italian. Kindly find your way to a chain restaurant that serves bland, unseasoned, frozen-then/microwaved meats, sauces that are fit for an old folks home and an ""endless"" pasta and salad bar. Go to these places, because Guissepe's is not for you.  It's for lovers of true Northern/Northeast American Italian cuisine. Chicken Parm that is fried, NOT baked, thank you very much. Meatballs that use beef, veal and pork. Sauce that use LOTS of salt, as it should be. Leave your dietary worries at home.

 In a word: perfecto.

Robert's passion for music (he's a well known accomplished cellist in NY circles) and food is unparalleled. He is without peer in the state of Arizona.

"I discovered this place on my way to a comedy show! It was a Saturday night with an ASU game on and was not packed so we stopped in to get a drink and a bite to eat. First impression was nice! Everything looked clean and open, which i didn't expect from the outside appearance. 
The service was kinda slow. I have worked in the restaurant/bar industry for 10+ years and I understand how things can go wrong that the customers don't see so i am not going to be hard on these guys. (By the way, the girls are all dressed pretty skimpy and the guys are just short of guidos, so if you have small kids this may not be the place to bring em) So the drink service was slow and throughout we never were really sure who our server was. One girl took our drink order, another brought them, someone else took our food order, someone else brought our food, and someone else came over to see if all was ok... There had to be 15 employees and maybe 25 customers, not to mention the kitchen staff. 
So the service was slow and not sure why because we were constantly seeing the staff goofing around with one another and as mentioned before it was not busy. BUT the associates were very nice the entire time so it was not bad service my any means, just slow and a little unattentive. 
It seemed to turn into a club style late at night, which could explain the extensive staff. 
There is a wheel that you can spin with different actions on it, such as, ""kiss a random' '50% off bill"" ""go plastic"" (which apparently gives you a chance to win plastic surgery). I would suggest NOT attempting this if you are not single. 
Overall, the food was GREAT!!!! The place was clean (bathrooms could use attention). The service could use some tweeking. But we were happy with it!",high
"BEAUTIFUL! Phoenix doesn't get much more amazing then when you're looking down at her from Dobbins Lookout.

A few tips:
1. Get there before 6pm. The park closes the entry but if you're in, you can stay as long as you want. 
2. Be ready for a drive up a mountain -- scary cliffs and tight corners. Make sure you go slow, watch for hikers and cyclists, and overall be cautious.
3. If you're heading to the summit for the views (Dobbins Lookout) bring a jacket or blanket. It's cold and windy when the sun goes down, even in the summer.

There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout.",high
"The parking situation is ridiculous, seriously. If you can, walk/bike/bus. It's not worth the energy/effort otherwise.

Another downside? If you don't make 6 figures, dont' plan on buying anything here. Seriously. Nothing lends itself to everyday people. Except for m                   aybe Borders (outside of food options).

My most recent venture there was on a Fri afternoon and it was PACKED and we literally could not eat anywhere without a decent wait and we were starving... so we were stuck.

The bonus is the MoJo, Borders & Paradise there. But nothing else lends itself to my medicore income.",high
"On the verge of just giving one star I, I figured on 2 only because I enjoyed the cool open interior of the main restaurant. As far as the food. That is one star. 
While having just stopped in at the Ranch Market to pick up a few groceries, I was going to eat at the Market itself but decided to maybe try a place I had never tried near by instead. As I took my groceries to the car, I decided that since I had not yet tried ""Tradiciones"" I would give them a try. 
I enjoy the food at the Ranch Market-- tasty and authentic.  Since they are connected I THOUGHT the food would be the same. Boy was I wrong!  I don't know who they have cooking here, but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be A LOT better. 
The salsa should have been the first clue...it was just ok.  Again, knowing what they make in house next door, made this salsa pretty sad.  Wanting an Agua Fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 7+ varieties, I was disappointed they only had horchata and pina here. I got the pina, which was probably the best part of this meal. 
I was really craving some tacos, and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos. Also wanting to have a sopito, I thought WTH I will get the sampler platter and add a taco. 

The platter came with 2 mini chimis, 2 mini taquitos, 2 mini cheese enchiladas and a soptio each of chicken and beef. All looked good when it came out. I enjoyed the taco first...the last thing I was to enjoy on this culinary outing. Then, digging into the chicken enchiladas, the sauce was a ""mole"". This was not a good mole...way too sweet, someones idea of a mole. Yes, just because a mole has chocolate doesn't mean it's a chocolate sauce.  And the chicken, stringy bland kinda tough. Everything followed suit, bland not very authentic, someones idea of mexican food. It all reminded me of something I would get if in the Mid-west somewhere and wanted Mexican food...not Arizona! 

The only saving grace to this meal was that it was happy hour on a Saturday and the platter was 1/2 off and the taco was a buck so I left paying only $9 instead of $15. 

While I will continue to eat at the Market....I will pass on TRADICIONES...*blegh*.",high
"I don't think my husband will let me rate it anything less than 5 stars... 

Parking for us was okay since we did not park in the lot, we parked at neighboring house for 5 bucks.  Grabbed some towels from the hotel and staked out our claim on the lawn... People were very friendly.  My hubby met some folks from Dixon, IL the day before and they came by to say Hi... and of course, watching the Cubbies - can't beat that!!!",high

"Carl's has raised the price on its food so that the $6 burger is now actually almost $6. The big marketing ploy here was that you could get a burger for just a few dollars that was the same quality as what other places charge $6 for. Not anymore.
Additionally, they have not resolved the issue of employees that speak so little English that they are unable to either take or execute your order correctly. We have emailed Carl's in the past regarding this issue and are just tired of having to bring it to their attention when they get the order wrong (which is most times now). 
We have now decided to just go across the street to the In N Out burger at Fiesta Mall for any future burger runs. You can get a burger for half the price and the employees speak English and can get your order right.",high

"Delicious food, amazing martini's, and wonderful desserts. Every dish I have eaten here has been nothing short of awesome. First, to start they have house infused seasonal vodkas. You can see the vodkas steeping on the bar when you walk in. Appetizers are not overly filling - The frito misto is always seasonal so depending on the time of year you will get different things. The coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch. The same is true with the mozzarella. The cheese was fresh and the crunchy crust of fried coating around it was perfect. 

As far as entrees go, the portions are perfectly sized and flavorful. The pasta is perfectly cooked and coated with whatever you choose on the menu. I love the simplicity of some and the complexity of others. Finally, desert has always been good. Try the limoncello cheesecake or any flavor of gelato and you certainly won't be disappointed.",high

"I know my 2 girlfriends that absolutely LOVE this place will balk at my 4 stars instead of 5. But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating. 

We went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a ""valet"" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK. 

Sadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent. 

We ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about). 

For dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto. 

And honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini). 

And hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars. Fair enough?  :)",high
"I went here last year when I was in AZ, I thought it was God's gift to Mexican food... I was a bit tipsy last year when I went there... I went again last week, it was ""ehhhh"". Don't get me wrong, still good, but not as wonderful as I remembered... not even close. 

We had to wait an hour for a table, the waiter made us wait about 15 minutes (not kidding) for water and chips/salsa... Seriously, 15 minutes? You dumbass! 

The desserts were super good though, that was the upside...",high
"The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine. China Magic Noodle House, however, is the real deal. This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA, as well as noodle houses that I've frequented in Taipei.

They have a great selection of cold noodle, hot noodle and soup noodle dishes. And, a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles). There's always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce.

If you're looking for a reasonably priced, ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley), China Magic Noodle House should be near the top, if not first, on your list. the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein.",high
"great food... HUGE wine list (same as Kashmere)...  whatever you do make sure to get there cob salad thing (stedson chopped salad)... I substituted the salmon for chicken, but it is still out of this world... i know people that have brought in chefs from out-of-town to figure out what is in it so they can bring it home to their city... don't remember much else... but i remember i have never had anything bad since i have been going there.",high
"I have never written a review, but the food at Havana Cafe was so underwhelming (and not in the least bit good) that I feel compelled to share. 
I ordered the Pollo Ajillo which, in reality, was a pile of salt with a side of chicken and rice. I opted for Arroz con Gandules instead of white rice as it has been years since I have had this tasty Puerto Rican side. The whole thing was almost inedible... I came home and actually brushed my teeth immediately, it was so bad!  My husband had the Pollo Cubano, which was equally underwhelming and nothing that we could not make at home ourselves.  The restaurant gets an extra star for the wonderful Cafe Cubano and the extremely attentive wait staff .  I had high hopes for this place but the next time I have a craving for Cuban food, I will be heading to Sabor Cubano.",high

"Steak, yes, but 2 other words first come to mind when reminiscing about Modern Steak: Retail Therapy.

No, I'm not talking about the fact that Modern Steak is conveniently (albeit awkwardly) located in Scottsdale's Fashion Square. Instead, I think back fondly on a delightful little cocktail -- Belvedere, Grand Marnier, strawberry, basil and lemon juice, served chilled in a martini glass (as expected), but also with a little carafe of extr drinky-drink (unexpected), complete with a suspended ice-ball to keep your drink cold while you sip -- without watering it down. GENIUS. 

Ok, ok, so you're wondering: why the 3 stars? Well, genius cocktails only get you so far. I like to think that I've sampled a fair number of steaks in my day, from frou-frou to straight-from-farm fresh, and I gotta say that the whole steak experience at Modern Steak was about a 3 -- not bad, but not amazing. Just pretty...average. And for $46, I'm not %100 convinced it was worth it. Let me elaborate:

 - 12 oz. filet: I ordered it three of their five sauces -- the Steak Sauce (which cost extra...bummer) and the House-Made Ketchup. Now, one of the sauces that I simply a-dore with a nice steak is a Peppercorn sauce...so I was a little bummed when they didn't have one. So after getting a recommendation for the Steak Sauce, I went with it, and it was...well, kind of a let down. I didn't love either sauce, truth be told. Granted, I haven't tried the other three, so I guess I'll have to go back and check them out, but all in all, my steak experience was lessened by these sauces, rather than heightened. Boo.

 - Sides: we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Yukon Gold Potato Puree. The sprouts were...meh, but I'm willing to admit that I've been spoiled by the best brussel sprouts of all time at a little place called Larchmont Grill in Los Feliz, CA. They are fantastic. But even so, I'm not convinced these were really that great...I felt they were a definite let down. As for the potatoes, they were literally SWIMMING in butter, which made them very difficult to eat...and to top it all off, both sides were pretty small, even for two people. 

All in all, I felt the level at which the meal was prepared was a bit sub-par considering the prices and what I can imagine they were going for...there are a lot of restaurants that do what they do, and do it a lot better, so if they want to compete, they're going to need to up their game. UP it. 

Combined with the fact that we were sitting awkwardly on the patio, which was really just sort of jutting out into the mall, I can't justify more than 3 stars. However, would I try it again? Absolutley. Get the steak? Maybe not. But I think that, for a relatively new restaurant, they're well on their way.",high
"This review corresponds to my first Check-In to Oregano's. 

Outside of the wait times, I've not had a bad experience @ Oreganos. The food was good, the people were friendly and I had a good time. This visit was no exception. Even when my wife got meat in her minestrone soup, the situation was handled impressively well. I've known for years that my wife is a VERY picky eater when dining out, she left all smiles and so did I.

Keep up the good work.",high
"My friend who I was visiting and I went here for a fundraiser type of a deal.  I don't know what I was expecting but I really liked the island concept of the place.  My friend recommended a salad and I got a Caribbean chicken salad with some sort of coconut rice, chicken,  oranges, pineapple, tortilla strips, etc.  Well, the salad was huge!!!  The honey lime dressing was very flavorful and complimented the salad well.  We shared the rumbi fries, which were a combination of sweet and regular fries, and as aforementioned in some other reviews, I love the sweet potato fries and wish they all could have been that (do I sound like the Beach Boys?).  

The decor was pretty cute and the music was great (Marley, Buffett type stuff).  The rice bowls looked fantastic, as did the sandwiches.  The prices were pretty good, considering the amount of food you received.",high
"Pita Jungle can do NO WRONG in my eyes! 

The food has always been amazing! I have been going here for 10 years or so and have never left displeased.  Also they are a home spun local business, which always makes me happy! 

Yes, they do have hipper then thou hipster working there, but those hipsters can sure make a mean hummus! 

I have many favorites which is starting to make it hard when I go there, because I want them all! Pita Jungles portions are always so generous that I have never even finished what I ordered. 

My new fav is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, the mix of the lentils and rice with the caramelized onions over the fresh mixed greens with that lemon vinaigrette is WHOA! Its incredibly filling, split it with 2 or 4 friends, seriously! 

Another fav is off the starters section, but its so much food that I never finish! The lavosh pita crisp! Its like a fancy spicy supped up cheese crisp! 

Thank You Pita Jungle for bringing bomb diggity food to the valley!",high

"We had a pretty darn good time.

Decided to take my two nieces to the festival.  Our total cost for 3 of us w/ 2 bracelets before food and extras was $64 - and the girls got on almost every ride, even the big, scary ones!  We went on a Friday at 4ish and the crowd was perfect and relaxed.. absolutely no lines.  Come 6pm, though, that all changed.  The lines got big and it started to not matter to get our bracelets worth of rides for the wait in line (plus the cold night air!).  Also, come 6pm, it just got plain ridiculous with all these little high school kids wearing skimpy clothes and making out and talking bad (where are these kid's parents!?!.. who raised these kids!?!).. it got annoying real quick.

The shows:
- Ostrich Race at 6pm was good - kinda funny, but not that entertaining
- Monkey Show at 9pm was AWESOME - I saw this show last year when we went with the in-laws and I *still* laughed my butt off (easily amused maybe?)
- Petting Zoo - LOVE this.. they had a lot of baby goats (my fave!) and the animals were never menacing and actually very docile.
- In the past I saw the trapeze show and it was entertaining, though the motorcycles in the metal sphere was quite impressive and very entertaining

Overall, the price was decent for the entertainment and the rides the gals got to enjoy; the food was typical fair food (FYI, DO shop around.. prices change across similar products by 2-3$ sometimes, so feel free to shop around for water bottles and other food staples); the staff running the rides were decent people (not creepy, which can be the status quo); the ambiance is good (not OVERLY ghetto) but caution that after 7pm, it gets more crowded with high school kids.. so more lines and more stupid conversations you get to listen to.. yay!",low
"Set in a restored 1913 bungalow, Cibo (pronounced ""CHEE-boh"") has hardwood floors, exposed brick, a stained-glass panel and a fireplace to set the mood while revitalizing the downtown Phoenix area with beautiful salads, antipasto, artisanal pizzas and housemade fresh pasta.
    I flew in for business on a Wednesday night. My friends picked me up and they decided to take me to Cibo. 
   Right off the bat, I was impressed with the ambiance this place exudes. Every corner of this place is romantic. Great for small parties, or just two. 
   We were seated outside at a table for four. The server was very well versed with the wine list, and the menu. She right away offered some appetizer ideas, and wine parings. All good offerings. We decided on a bottle of Vipra rossa. It was over all a good wine, and went well with dinner. Also we ordered the 3 Pair Buschetta. This little gem was awesome. It came to our table on a cutting board type platter. Three little buschetta slices each having a different topping. First was grape tomatoes and basil, the second had cannelini beans, and the third had prosciutto crudo and mozzarella. Ah Mazz ING. 
    Being that I wasnt feeling super adventurous on the meal, I just ordered the Diavola pizza for one. Average pizza I'd have to say, was not very inventive. Good presentation though.

"in honor of the impending superbowl XLV, i wanted to write my majerles review. 

this year though, instead of hitting up a sports bar for the biggest day in football, i'll be going to a party. a real rager. if i wasn't though, i would definitely be pressed up against majerles front door bright and early superbowl morning. it's a great sports bar.

the weirdest thing about majerles is their name. someone finally told me it wasn't pronounced ""mah jer lees"" like i had thought.... it's pronounced ""mar lees"". so let me get that out first.

i'm a big sports nut.... well, let me rephrase that. i'm a big sports nut when it involves REAL sports. i won't make fun of anyone, but if it's not football, baseball, basketball or hockey i don't wanna hear about it. unless of course we're talking about extreme sports like surfing, skateboarding, etc. 

being a fan of sports makes me a fan of sports bars. there are only 3 main things i need in order for a sports bar to be great in my opinion. let me lay them out for you:

a good selection of beers, happy hour specials and bar snacks--- yes, majerles has this in spades. large selection of beers and any sports bar that has perrier jouet, vueve clicquot and dom champagnes must be praised.(mostly because i think this is absolutely hilarious. WHO orders pricey champers at a sports bar? haha!) also, put me down as a fan of their reuben reuben and tenderloin sliders. yum.

the service--- there's nothing worse than sidling up to a bar, excited to watch your team kick some ass and ordering a drink from a bartender that seems bored and unhappy. every bartender i've come in contact with at majerles truly loved being at work (or they at least acted like it). bartenders attitudes really carry a lot more weight then they realize. happy bartender =  happy bar patrons

the strategic placement of large TV sets for comfortable viewing pleasure--- yep. they designed this with real sports fans in mind. no matter where i sit, i can see a multitude of TV's with little blocking my view. 

so they have it all, and i likey. go here if you're looking for a good bar to watch the superbowl... or any sporting event for that matter. 

oh, and GO PACK GO!!!",high

"Service. 
Was great until checkout.....
Matthew, a twenty something with brown hair, was fine during the first few minutes of bagging but he asked me if I wanted my pizzas in a bag. I assumed it would be put in one bag per pizza. They were digorno pizzas with the bred sticks or wings.
Matthew told us that they wouldn't fit in a bag. So my boyfriend said it was fine without a bag, but I knew they could fit one in a bag per box. So I asked for a large paper bag. Matthew held up the box to the bag And told me it wouldn't work. I just stood there and continued to place groceries on the line. When I noticed he put one in a bag and the inter in another plastic bag. THEN... Things were getting hostile between the cashier brittani and him. They kept discussing work related topics sucks as the time of the checkout. The cashier seemed irritated with the day that the bagging area was over crowded and backed up. Seemed like she wanted to say something. After that i noticed he was doing s terrible job bagging which caused bags to rip. putting a wide variety of packages in one bag  Matthews attitude changed as well giving a sarcastic goodbye.

great, relaxing place to do homework or study.  depending on the day and the time, you'll find professors, honors college kids, hipster bike folk - the whole gamut of the non-party-bro asu population.

"As you may have read in a previous review, so graciously provided by Dally, that Four Peaks is our post-Tuesday night hockey watering hole. We normally show up stinky and limping or in some sour mood or another. Somehow we always leave a little happier, but still limping, well I do anyway. 

Unfailingly, we are greeted by the bouncer, who no longer cares to see our ID's, either because he can see the age in our strides or because he knows us now. I would like to believe the latter. Also, waiting for us is the lovely and nicht so talented Karina. Bless her poor soul for putting up with our asinine questions about her life and our requests for more water. She humors us anyway. 

We are made to feel like this place is home, at least for a couple of hours on a Tuesday night. Karina knows what we order for drinks and never has to ask, just brings. I usually switch between a simple salad with a great balsamic vinaigrette or a plate of fries. I know, diametrically opposed. Just depends on the mood and how committed I am that day/week to my diet. I always get the 8th St Ale though. It is very good and for 3 bucks can't be beat. 

I have enjoyed the pretzels, the now ""famous"" nachos, with chicken mind you, the spinach-artichoke dip, some of the various wing flavors, and a pizza. For late night dining they are all very palatable.  I have a funny wing story, but I think it is only funny to me, Dallas, Z, and our friend Peter.  If we ever get the elusive Z to join, I will make sure he shares his story on here.

Until then, check out Four Peaks in Scottsdale.  The late night menu satisfies and is not hard on the wallet.  Tell Karina Brad sent you.  You won't get a discount, maybe just a laugh.",high
"I love the Salt Cellar for being the lazy woman's go-to place for seafood.  If you get lobster or crab from them, the waitress will crack and de-shell it for you; it's such a great service since a lot of the time I am hesitant to get any kind of crustacean because I don't like getting messy and spending all that time getting the meat out of the shell.  The lobster here, while technically from Maine, is flown in fresh from Boston, and they offer 1.25 lb, 3 lb, and occasionally a showcase jumbo lobster.  When I went here they were touting an 8 lb lobster for those with the stomach (and coin) to spend a pretty penny on the Yao Ming of lobsters.

While the sides are very basic, the seafood is understandably the real star of the show.  While I was happy with my fresh lobster, I did try some salmon wellington, which was some of the best tasting salmon I've had in some time.  It was very tender and moist, and very fresh.  I'm also happy to report that they have soft shell crabs here this season, which is one of my favorite seafood items.

The ambiance itself, for me at least, is a bit lacking.  They don't call it the Salt Cellar for nothing, for when you descend into the restaurant through a flight of stairs, it's very dark and a bit damp and chilly.  The lighting for me is too yellow for me, and everything in general seems antiquated.  I remember eating here years and years ago, and it seems like they haven't changed anything about the decor since then!",high
"After my sixth or so visit here at Big Earl's I have to give them a four plus rating. My first time here was opening night and it was ok...the second time was improved...third time good...etc. Now when I come in the smoke is starting to impermiate in the walls leaving a wonderful smokey resonance in the dining room, and the food has become exponentially better!!!

I am like most people in the serious dining population, a lover of all things pork. And while they do some real good pig here, I am thrice impressed with the beef offerings! I like to judge a restaurant on the dishes I would absolutely return for, and the brisket is for sure that item here. Actually, the beef ribs are also one of those ""return for"" items as well. They, much like the brisket, are perfectly smokey, wonderfully seasoned, and impossibly tender. I highly suggest either one.

As for the sides, I can honestly recommend the collards, potato salad, and the Mac and cheese...although it's not a creamy Mac, but it is gooey enough to pass my palate's stamp of approval. 

A huge selling point for me when I dine out are the drink specials, or selection. They are GREAT here!!! Being a total whisky slut, I am in heaven here, with dozens of delicious options, and the handful of beers on tap here make me happy for the change in libation after a few too many. Try the front porch cocktail, one of my top five here in town.

Big Earl's has proven that with time, all things become better. Like I said before, each separate visit has been more fulfilling than the last. I can only imagine how the experience will be, come summer and autumn, my guess is pretty damn amazing!",high

While this location has a steady customer base, I have never had to wait longer then five minutes to be seated, unlike the other location at 92nd Street, Win! Service has always been fantastic. Quick on to seat, quick to get drinks, quick on refills, and delicious food from breakfast to dinner items. As other reviewers have stated, the Jewish sliders are amazing, but I have also enjoyed different wraps and sandwiches. Prices are a little higher, but the food is well worth the money. There is a ""bar area"" with about six stools and two TV's that you are able to see from your tables/booths which usually has ESPN on.

3.  They do have table shuffle board. 
4.  They do have the naked lady game.... otherwise known as Photo Hunt... the best bar game of all time.

5.  It's a good mix of people and pretty cheap.  Unpretentious and awesome!
6.  It's bikeable, but I feel like I've traveled long distances to get there (I think that is because crossing Souther is intimidating)",high
"I was pleasantly surprised to find the Phoenix Public Market across the parking deck from the Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. It's too bad it's not located on the ground floor of the school, replacing the space currently occupied by Subway. It would be much healthier for the students.

I had their breakfast protein shake, which was AWESOME! Even though it was $6, I ended up having TWO!

While the shop is not as big as a Whole Foods, it does provide the organic and healthy staples, while serving fresh salads, pastries, and different types of chocolates. I didn't get to purchase the local bran of organic ice cream, which seems to be popular. Maybe next time I'm back in Phoenix.

I also liked their little coffee shop in the back room, which is separate from the main shopping area, giving you a bit of quiet to read a book or check your email.

Lastly, all the staff are quirky, yet incredibly friendly. They offered up suggestions for local things to do, and were generally helpful.

Overall, love this place. I wish it a long and successful life. The world needs more Phoenix Urban Markets.",high
"Happy hour in Phoenix from 5PM to midnight on Thursdays? Yes, at Devil's! Hey, it's Phoenix; you need to escape the 100 plus degree scorching weather in a casual place. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is fun and lively. Mind you, my disclaimer about Phoenix qualifies my prior observations of Devil's-it's good for being in Phoenix. Devil's is a fun place to get stupid and have a good time in a casual setting. It does remind of a frat party though.",high

"My meal at FnB last weekend was one of the best I've had in Arizona. I love everything about this place, the food, the cocktails, the staff, the atmosphere.

It was a rainy Sunday. I knew the restaurant was right next to Cowboy Ciao, but managed to walk right by it (my friends noticed me go by). I turned back, and Pavle was nice enough to wait at the door, and said ""Ben?"" as I was about to pass by again. I agree with what everyone else said here, Pavle really makes you feel at home.

I started with the slivered fennel salad and a ginhound. I split the order with a friend, and they were more than happy to bring the salad split  onto two plates for us. I love citrus, and these were a very refreshing start to my meal. 

Next up was the trout. It was presented stacked on top of the sunchokes and caramelized onions, with some wonderful broth on the plate. The combination of flavors was rich, and amazing, and the presentation ensured that every bite was as good as the last. I could eat this every visit, but I sampled the chicken and lamb, and was just as blown away. For desert I had lemon cake with ice cream and strawberry compote. 

FnB has been receiving a lot of positive buzz lately. It's well deserved. If you haven't visited yet, you're missing out.",high

"My bf and I drove in from ""the city"" lol and met some friends here for brunch.  We didnt have to wait long to get seated which was great.  The waitress came and took our drink order and right away she didnt seem too thrilled.  So I ordered an omelet and asked for turkey sausage instead of the toast or pancakes it came with, she looked at me like I was asking for a cure to cancer and proceeded to tell me that I would have to be charged full-price.  Well duh, I kinda figured and since I asked it was probably ok.  Needless to say, we waited 30 mins to get our food, which we had to ask her for.  My omelet was cold, I didnt get the turkey sausage I had ordered but she did add it to the check.  Thank god we had a groupon or else it would have been a total loss.

"I was extremely happy that we chose Cool Cuts 4 Kids for my son's first big boy hair cut. He was instantly comfortable and drawn in by all of the friendly things they have for children. He was given the choice of a movie or playing a video game, of course knowing exactly what he wants went straight for the video game (Sonic on XBOX). It was pretty much a breeze from that point the little guy was hypnotized and didn't even realize what was going on w/ his beautiful, lovely long hair =( obviously they need to focus on distracting the mom's lol! Jessie who cut my sons long hair was a doll, she didn't seem to be bothered by the mother breathing down her neck as she hacked off my little's hair or the boyfriend taking a copious amount of pictures and video of the whole event.

"Amanda at Butterfly Petals did the flowers for my wedding. I didnt want to spend  a lot on them and shaved it down to only needing my bouquet, three boutonnieres and two corsages.

She also did all of this via email. which I give her total kudos for. 

On the day of my wedding, there was a fabulous bouquet waiting for me as well as perfect corsages and boutonnieres for my groom and our parents. Amanda waited for me, even though I was terribly late, to make sure I was happy with her creations which really gave a personal touch.

"I purchased a pair of Naot Paris sandals ($160 with tax) at The Shoe Mill.  I considered buying on-line, but decided to shop locally instead.  I ended up paying more, but assumed that I was paying for the superior service.  I wore my new shoes to work on Friday.  By the end of the day, I had developed blisters on both feet near my toes and my ankles.  I was surprised because I had read many reviews stating how comfortable Naot sandals are and the salesman who helped me confirmed that I was buying the correct size.  Sadly, I took them back to the store the next day.  To my surprise, I was told that The Shoe Mill does not take returns.  I have never tried to return shoes, so it didn't occur to me to ask this question when I made the purchase.  However, as I stated, I expected full service from a high end shoe store.
I will no longer shop at The Shoe Mill.  It's been three days and my feet are still recovering.  It's a constant reminder of how dissatisfied I was with my purchase.  I will definitely shop Zappos next time.",low
"One of my new favorite neighborhood bars! 

We had a Canada Day shindig here and it's a great little neighborhood bar with fair drink prices and super friendly bar staff. You'd never know that there's a bar inside when you get to the parking lot behind the Ice Rink - just look for the signs on the top of the building. 

They have lots of TVs for hockey fans and the bar looks right out onto the ice so you can watch people skate. They had a great jukebox and the Rockband kit so you can rock out with all your newest bar friends. 

For food selection you have BBQ, BBQ, or BBQ...either beef, pork, or chicken, with a side for $6.50. Tasty stuff! Great beer selection including Molson Canadian or Labatt Blue.",high
"Okay, it almost seems a shame to burst the bubble of the positive reviews of this place, but I just have to. 

I'm not an Indian food expert, but I am a serious enthusiast and I've eaten at dozens of Indian places on three continents, not to mention my family being from the vicinity of that area of the world and therefore having grown up on curry and rice and all things spice.

We went here for lunch yesterday (Sunday), thanks to a Yelp/Aloqa recommendation after we'd had a romp at Estrella Mountain Park and were starving. The place was almost deserted at 1pm, with only one other table occupied - fair enough. We went for the buffet. And I have to say, it was simply ""okay"". The buffet didn't have a particularly wide variety of stuff - several items were cheap regulars such as the saag and the dhal - spinach and lentils for the uninitiated. They did have aloo zucchini, never seen that before - tasted okay, about as good as I'd have been able to make it (and that's actually not a compliment). No lamb dishes - disappointing, but unfortunately this is also rare.

Flavorwise, I found it boring and unspectacular. Saag is saag, tandoori chicken is tandoori chicken, except their chicken was very light on the tandoori smoke flavour. None of the food left the slight zing on my tongue that it should have. Rice was okay, but then you typically can't go wrong with cooking basmati (although another reviewer's mileage apparently differed on this count). We had our almost-3-year-old along and he did have a little rice, chicken and beef - it was his first real curry and thus a pretty substantial milestone for us. Then the wife went to get a little kheer and a gulab jamun ball. The kheer was watery but tasted okay - compared unfavourably to the sabudaana kheer at India Palace. The jamun ball was almost completely solid - you had to press real hard with a fork to cut it, normally they're nice and soft and soaked. However, another one I got was normal - so it was just the luck of the draw there. Beef curry was nice, although the first piece I ate was mainly fat - whatever, you get that and I don't mind it. The fried pakoras can normally be cut through with a fork. These you had to saw through with a knife - not great, chewy to the point of almost being crunchy. No samosas in the buffet. The naan was unusual. I've had a LOT of naan before and this stuff was the uncommon kind, not thick and pita-ey but instead a little more like a roti. It tasted very fresh - we had plain and also garlic - and the wife really liked it. Kid did too. I personally prefer the other sort of naan - softer and a little more substance to it, but this one had merit regardless. However, it took at least fifteen minutes after our food was served before the naan arrived.

All up, middle of the road as far as I'm concerned, although the wife quite liked it. Note that this is for the buffet only - we did not have a-la-carte and perhaps the to-order cooked food may have tasted better. I've had better buffets - the best one in Phoenix west of the 17 IMO is India Palace - a wider variety, a lot busier (as a result, I'm sure) and more flavourful food. Admittedly, I haven't tried any other Indian places south of Bell but west of the 17 except for Sutra. Bell appears to have most of them?

I would normally have given this place a flat three stars, but I'm going to give it an extra half and round up for a few reasons. Firstly, the waiter was real nice and very attentive - up to the standard of a typical US chain place, rather than the silent wanderers with the Easter Island statue facial expressions at other buffets who do no more than refill your water and clear your dirty dishes every fifteen minutes or so. He was asking us how we were doing, offered refills of my wife's iced tea at appropriate times etc. Spot on. Next, there's a buffet discount where all kids under 10 are $5 - however, we noticed that they appropriately knocked the price down to $3.50 for us, unbidden and I guess for the simple reason that he was set up in a high chair and obviously only ate 1/4 of a breakfast bowl worth of food in total. Third, the place had nice decor (although I was a bit concerned there were no tablecloths, with my kid banging his plastic sippy cup and spilling sh1t all over the tabletop) and thankfully they didn't have sh1tapple wudda-wudda-waa-waa pretentious bhangra muzak playing in a cheap attempt at making you feel like you're actually in India.

I'd eat here again, but only if I'm in the area and DYING for Indian food. It simply didn't measure up, either buffet-wise or flavour-wise. For first-timers, I can see how they would have enjoyed the experience - clean seating area, Americanized flavours and a good waiter. My experience, however, has been burned in over almost four decades and I've kicked the tyres of more cuisines from this area of the world than I can recount, especially Indian. Three and a half, rounded up to four, Seacrest out.",high
"I will say that the weakest link in this restaurant is the maturity of the staff.  We went for lunch and asked to sit on the patio.  Most of the people we're eating but then they sat a large group right next to us that only wanted to drink and smoke.  I know smoking it allowed on the patio but since it wasn't the only table available AND the rest of us we're eating food I think they should have sat them a little farther away from us.
Our order wasn't right but couldn't get the server to come back so we just let it go.  The food was great!  Had a few items from the small plates and then we had the bacon grilled cheese and the chicken sandwich.  Both very good.  
My biggest complaint is that we we're ignored unless we we're actively looking around for someone and then snagged someone as they walked by.  I will try again as this place is still trying to find its way but service needs to be stepped up for sure.",high
Super friendly staff and smoothies come out so fast...delicious too!,high
"I was a little hesitant of Zipps when we pulled in - didn't look from the outside like it would offer an awesome time.  Walking in around 7 on a Friday night revealed a place that was almost full.  We chose to sit on the chilly patio, which did have a couple of heaters.  The heaters were a little high up and less effective, but it was also one of the coldest nights this year. 

Service was fast and friendly, we never ran out of beer.  I got the BLT on Sourdough, and so did my friend, her husband got the Black and Blue Burger.  The fries were good, but not as crispy as I like.  The flavor was great and I ended up eating all of them.  The BLT was awesome! Tons of crispy bacon, and they cut it so that you were able to eat the sandwich without bacon attacking you.  The sourdough bread was thick cut and lightly toasted.

The burger was a little less than we expected - 2 nice size patties, but the blue cheese could have been done a little better, and it was very messy.  The onion rings were nice sized and with great, fluffy breading on them.

The on tap beer list was a little heavy on the cheap domestics for my taste, but they did have an Alaskan Amber that went great with the food.

We were able to sit and talk for several hours, and the server made sure that we always had what we needed.",high

"I went here with Friends last Friday.  All my friends and I use Yelp, at the end of the meal taking cost into perspective we all came to this is a 1 star place.  It was a huge disappointment after looking at the positive reviews.  Our 1st disappointment came because they had a ""limited"" beer list.  My good buddy just wanted an IPA and all they had was the normal domestic beers and a few other quality ones.  Then, the Spanish ham was not very good and once you take into account the price it was terrible.  We had a sausage plate where the sausage was dry.  The Calamari was extremely oily.  The only positive thing was the lamb chops but once you factor in price that was poor too.  We all came to the conclusion we would never go back.",low
"Met some friends here for happy hour the other day.  This is the old El Paso BBQ and they did a knockout job with the remodel. Great feel and warm colors to the place now.

"Since I'm on a low-carb diet, I never imagined I'd be able to eat pizza without cheating like a vengeful ex.  Then, thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I found Mamma Mia and its 10 carb pizza.  For $5.95+tax.  Sold.

Show up at the store, where there are a few people on the ""patio"" happily chowing down on what looks to be some tasty grub.  Once I walk inside, I feel the warm, home-owned vibe that makes my tummy smile.  I pay my dues (under $6.50 with tax minus tip), wait 6 minutes, and voila! the pizza is ready.  

Armed with crushed red pepper and fresh parmesan from the restaurant, I dig in when I return to my office, savoring each pepperoni-and-cheese covered bite.  This is not the best pizza I've had; however, I can't imagine a 10 carb pizza being any better.  Crispy, thin, wheat crust, flavorful ingredients, and a short drive from work?  Wow!  

I will return, and may upgrade my already high rating!",low

"I've actually never set foot inside this restaurant, so I can't comment on the place itself. But every now and then we've picked up orders from Old Spaghetti Factory at work, so I can comment on the food itself. 

The food is as basic as it gets. This is definitely ""family food."" Most adults won't complain about it, and kids will enjoy the simplicity. I recently had the Old Spaghetti Factory's Chicken Parm. I won't call it bland, but it's nothing that the average home chef couldn't cook up for their family. 

I will give the place credit for the portions. It's not expensive and you get a lot of food. While the chicken itself was not huge, it comes with Spaghetti, an entire loaf of bread and butter, and a side salad. The salad was way too plain for my taste, but at least I had a little bit of vegetables to go with my meal. It's also quick. Take out orders are almost always said to be ready within 10 to 15 minutes.",high
"Walk the other way, just walk right the hell the other way...

Here was how this played out.  Oktoberfest a few days ago.  Starting the night off.  I walk past this place and see a place that sells a slice of pizza for $1.99.  Good, right?  No.  

me: ""Hi, one slice of pizza please""
guy: ""you buy drink with it, 4 dollars.""
me: ""no, just one slice of pizza""
guy: ""we do not sell one slice, you have to buy a drink.  4 dollars""

I should have pulled a flag on this play at this point, but knowing I was going to be drinking I move forward wanting food in me. Not a wise move.

me: ""so, I can't buy one slice?""
guy: ""no, you buy a drink with slice, 4 dollars.""
me: ""It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu or walls""
guy: ""No, do not sell one slice.
me: ""what the... O.K., give me 2 slices of pizza""
guy: ""you buy two slices then.""
me: ""yes, Jesus Christ, yes""
guy: ""toppings?""
me: ""no, no toppings.  cheese.""
guy: ""we have toppings.""

what is this guy, fucking deaf? 

me: ""no thanks""

I give him the money.

guy: ""it take 10 minutes, you wait.""

I don't think they run the air conditioner in this place, so I wait outside.

Pizza comes out.  Tastes like absolute crap.  I eat it outside because in September in Chandler Arizona it is cooler outside then inside this place.  I think they had the thermostat set to ""HELL"" Guy working or running the place comes outside and stares me down as I am eating.  I'm sure if you want to eat here you can check the dumpster for plenty of slices to try beforehand to avoid having to pay for one.  Excuse me, avoid having to pay for two.  However after what I had served to me I'm pretty sure they will beat you to the garbage cans and sell it back to some other unsuspecting soul.  I was the only one dumb enough to finish all the food.  Wouldn't eat here if there was a natural disaster and this place was the last to be ransacked for provisions.  I'd keep walking.

The food is Outstanding and I've liked everything except the Catfish fried. My wife enjoys the catfish, but I think its lacking flavor, however they fry it to a cripy golden brown crust. I could just eat the crust and forget the fish. 

We've been twice now and I'm sad to say that we pretty much ordered the same things twice. The garlic parmesan wings and honey habenero wings are our favorites (of course we haven't tried any others, so take it with a grain of salt) catfish, corn nuggets, fried okra, french fries, and coleslaw. And to finish it all off...the best Biscuits of all time, if you consider a biscuit a French dougnut.(beignet) a biscuit. Seriously the best thing ever, but you feel pretty guilty afterwards.

"My sister took me here last week its crazy that I haven't been yet right? This is her regular go to place. Not much I can say after so many reviews here already. The patio looked very nice I bet its the place to be when its cooler. It was kind of empty in here but it was late afternoon. My sis ordered us some Drunken Italian Sodas they were made super strong though usually this would not detour me however I had my child with me and had to drive all the way back home after. Basically it tasted like straight vodka in a giant glass it was a bit much for me mid day and after adding Sprite to it which I stole from my daughter I still couldn't drink it without feeling like I'd be a drunken Mexican after. I didn't understand this drink maybe someone can explain it to me? My sis told me their Sangria was good but I had no idea they made Caipirinha's next time that's what I get no question.
 The food: We had the garlic lemon hummus it was really good the ingredients separately didn't have much taste to them but together it was really nice the pita bread was excellent. The kid couldn't stop eating the hummus she got so full she barely touched her mac n cheese so we brought that home along w all the leftover hummus. Now on to the Tejano burger we decided to split.

"Y'know, rarely do I buy the ""extended warranty"" that most places try to peddle on you nowadays. If you buy the item from a reputable manufacturer, it should be unnecessary. 

In the case of tires, I have to make an exception. 

You can control the quality of tires you buy and put on your car, but not the quality of construction workers who don't know how to secure their nails, screws and bolts for travel on highways, streets and other local thoroughfares. They're a nefarious bunch for the most part. I'm not for extra taxes, but I'm contacting my local elected officials to institute a tax on all businesses who transport these little metal devils on the streets we drive...and stiff penalties/massive fines if they get caught dropping a load of these on the highway. 

For the second time in a year, one of my tires caught one of the little buggers -- this last one was not a nail or screw, mind you, but a BOLT.  I pulled my receipts from the glove compartment, used Yelp to find the nearest Discount Tire, and called for a tow. 

The replacement certificates I got were $16 per tire (back in NC, but they're good here too), and worth every penny. The folks at this Discount Tire location were extremely nice, and had me in and out of there in about 30 minutes (with no appointment). There is even free water for customers. They were able to fix the tire instead of replacing it, which is fine (as long as it holds). 

Every Discount Tire location I've visited has been great as far as the transparency of what you're getting, the quality of customer service, and the wait. In a town of 4.3 million people and never-ending road construction, I have to recommend the free replacement warranty on your tires, no matter where you buy them. I prefer getting mine from DT.",high

I'd been to the Phoenix location years ago and remember wishing they were closer to my home, and my wish was granted... this new location is less than a mile from where I live!

Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a self-serve bath.  I initially called to see if a groomer was in, but they were booked out for weeks.  Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper, but it was fun... and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well.  Sara helped us out and explained our options.  We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner, brushes, towels, cologne, etc... It was easy and quick - bonus! Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so!

Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection, homemade treats, eco-friendly collars and leashes, etc...

I'll definitely head back to Wag N' Wash again really soon... so psyched that they moved to my 'hood!",high

"I love a place that lets me do whatever I want. I can go to this place and scarf down a whole bunch of pretty good tasting frozen yogurt for 160 some-odd calories. I can pig out on Thrifty Brand Ice Cream - oh joy! I can pretend I am in Hawaii and have shave-ice (snow cones to mainlanders). I can get a puppy cup of frozen yogurt for my dog. How COOL is THAT??? I can get quarts of stuff to bring home. AND - here's the big one....the people are actually really, really nice! Okay - I've read the other reviews - the frozen yogurt is good - nothing that will drive you to ecstacy - but good enough to hit that ""I need something cold and frozen"" spot. My dog loves the lo-cal treat. So, depending on the Length of my hike, it is yogurt, ice cream, sometimes both......you get double punches on Wednesday and the puppy cup is free if you bring your puppy.",high

"Ordered the King Carlos IV.  It was HUGE, two of us ate half of it.  I thought it would be smaller than that.  It had all the major meats plus hotdogs, cheeses, and a siracha type sauce.  I think this was featured in diners, drive-ins, and dives.  It was very good but just wow huge.  It came with a side of ruffled chips.  Very nice people.  The fruit smoothies were good the horchata decent but not the best I've had.  Great bang for your buck though.  I'd go again and try something a bit more sensibly sized.

There was a wait of about 15 minutes or so.  Very popular on a Saturday for lunch :)",low
"A nice place to shop, but I wouldn't want to live there. 

I never used to be a department store shopper, but recently Ive discovered that nicer cloths just seem to fit better. Go figure. While I still like getting a deal, I usually wait until there is a clearance or sale or some type. The macy's at scottsdale fashion square seems to have more selection, such as more size options for the items you seem to like and a few more items to choose from also. For guys, I would suggest checking out the Dillards at fashion square; the mens dept is about the size of this entire macy's store. 2 or 3 times a year dillards has an awesome clearance event and you can pickup 65% off clearance prices; which are usually already 50 - 70% off the original price.

I digress; this is supposed to be a review of macy's. If you're in the biltmore area and looking for higher end quality shopping go ahead and check them out, then travel down camelback to fashion square mall when they tell you the item you like is only available in your size at a different store.",high
"I liked the fish.  It was delicious.  The cole slaw was also very tasty.  Not too sweet.  A bit tangy.  I like that.

  The shrimp was okay.  A bit rubbery, but then what does one might expect for a seafood place in the middle of a desert?

My biggest problem with this place was the price of the food.  It is just too expensive for what amounts to frozen food plopped into a deep fryer.  I could buy frozen fish at the grocery store and then come home and plop it into my little deep fryer and it would taste about the same and be a lot cheaper.  

I just wish it wasn't so expensive.  Especially considering this in the hood.  If you know what I mean.  I don't mind driving down to the hood for some fried fish, but only if it is reasonably priced.",high
"I always find good used records at Zia.  I know I'll come out with something.  They're pricing is usually pretty high on records/artists/genres that are popular or trendy.  That's pretty standard for anyplace.  The Ghost of Eastside keeps their prices slightly lower with more obscure selection.

However, the flipside is that Zia will overlook gems in their used stock and price them pretty low.  Probably because they don't know much about certain band line-ups, labels or releases in general.  I've found quite a few gems for two or three bucks in the used section.  

Used records are where it's at.  There is no rationale in buying anything new because they'll press those things in such high numbers that they're not rare anymore.  I'll still buy some new things from bands and such.  Not a lot.

Anyhow, I inadvertantly went to this Zia on record store day.  I was eating with my kids at that Chinese place around the corner.

I found a bunch of shit (not all rare but stuff I wanted): The Shit Licker's EP ""Cracked Cop Skulls (total early swede crust/dis), Orchid s/t 7"" on Hand Held Heart, The Automatics ""Golden Hits"" and ""Makin Out"", Chubbies ""Im the King"" 7"" on Sympathy, The Tie That Binds ""Adding Machine"" 7"", Gravy Train ""Hello Doctor"" LP. 

All %15 off for record store day.

I'll always check out Zia.  I'll always check out anyplace that sells records but I have to say that I do like Zia.",high

"I'm always searching for quality food at a fair price for lunch.  There are tons of sit down expensive lunch places and lots of fast food (junk food) places too.  When I read the reviews on Chestnut Lane I hustled right on over.  The concept is right on but the execution leaves a LOT to be desired.  

First challenge is getting a parking place and I was lucky.  The line to order didn't look too bad when I arrived so i was feeling lucky.  However, the line took forever to move forward causing the people waiting to shuffle back and forth in a very confined space as there was lots of foot traffic trying to enter and exit.  The woman at the register took each order, processed the payment, and then proceeded to prepare the drinks  and sides for each order.  The drinks are somewhat specialty items and are kind of labor intensive, especially considering that the order line is at a total standstill.  SLOW!  After way too long a wait, I finally was able to order...then the real wait began!  It was a good 25 minutes before my order came up and it was just a TURKEY SANDWICH!  I felt lucky, though, as the woman ahead of me in line was still waiting for her SANDWICH after I had finished mine and was driving away!

Sometimes a long wait is mitigated by the awesomeness of the food.  Well, at Chestnut Lane this is unfortunately not the case.  I mean it was a decent turkey sandwich, but when I saw the almost $16 charge for a TURKEY SANDWICH and ICED TEA I was expecting something fabulous.  It wasn't all that.  

If you decide to go to Chestnut Lane, maybe you could park in the spacious Jack-in-the Box lot just to the east.  And grab a Breakfast Jack to hold you over during your long wait!",high
"Great! came here with my girlfriend and my mom and left very satisfied! We ordered some of there apparently famous bruschetta, some panini and a bottle of their Zweigel wine from Austria and it was all fantastic!

"Unlike other reviewers, I didn't like the buffet, though my friends from work think it's a good value. However, I've been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now, and have ALWAYS liked the food. FOI is my first choice for Indian cuisine in Phoenix, out of the four other Indian restaurants in the valley I've tried. 

Yes, FOI is in a strip mall, but once inside, the ambiance is pleasant. It seems quite clean, I never got sick from anything I ate there (that's saying a lot, as I admit to being a fussy eater), and the waitstaff is helpful. Bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature, but the volume is low or completely muted, so you can watch or choose not to, it isn't distracting.   (Here's a footnote about that: I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election. My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar, watching electoral results, so he asked our waiter if we could watch too. After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables, it was quite late in the evening, silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on).

Regarding the food: I love their mattar paneer (cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy, with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese).  My super-spicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo (super-spiced as he requests).  Tandoori shrimp, chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier, the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh, warm and crunchy. Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be, biryani rice is overpriced (I'd stick with basmati rice as a side dish), and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink, similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat. My spicy friend says his gin-and-tonic was weak, and they don't have ingredients to make a Bloody Mary, but hey, FOI is an Indian restaurant, so I can't fault them too much for that! 

Other pluses: open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants (seating ends at 9:30 pm); very fast with takeout orders; there's lots of parking; the 16 North bus stop is nearby; silverware, glasses, white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean.",high

Whole Foods Market.
Ladies, you're young and vibrant...today. 
But as the years drag on, you notice changes. Subtle changes, such as:

*crow's feet
*saddlebags
*sagging butt and or tits, 
*and orange skin from all the tanning products, your complexion now resembling that Louie V handbag you've been toting your Shitzadoodle around in.

You've got a choice to make.

Spend all your money now on organic, free range shit, this in an effort to remain healthy looking, or, shop for a lot of the same stuff at Costco, where you can load up, get twice your money's worth, and have a shitload of cardboard boxes you won't have a clue what to do with. 

But the real bonus will be how in only a few short years, you'll have saved enough money for a good plastic surgeon, which you're going to need anyway if you have any plans to remain living in Scottsdale for any length of time.

My opinion?
I highly recommend the latter and here's why.

Scottsdale has a serious shortage of fish-lipped women with feline looking facial features, who routinely wear yoga pants telegraphing their hiked-up thongs. 
Poor thong....how sad that your fate...to be cast to a fifty-something, saggy-butt host.
Ladies, is that what you want?
To idly standby, watching, as the ranks of this bass-cat looking oddity dwindle in population?
I didn't think so.

The choice is yours.
Beautiful and broke from shopping at Whole Foods today.
Or, aging not so gracefully with the help of medical science, an overzealous plastic surgeon, and Victoria's Secret, which I assure you with one of her thongs in yoga pants will be anything but. 
A lot of good all that free range organic crap did. 

If you do come here, try the hot deli, where you can get every kind of ethnic food, save for Ethiopian. It helps after a late night at work, on your way home, when you don't feel like eating fast food. They also have a taco and pizza bar, fresh bakery, and a smoked meats section where you can get some of the worst barbecue and smoked meats I've ever tasted. 
The only thing I'll recommend in this place other than the hot deli, is the chocolate and coffee bar, which seems to have a ton of delights that are supposedly good for you. 
I doubt it.",high
"my husband and I started going to Keegan's on Sunday's for their brunch, which is pretty decent. If you get there after 10am, the bar is open, which is a plus in my book. 
We've eaten lunch and dinner there a few times as well. They have a really good french onion soup, another soup I think was chicken pepper jack and the cobb sandwich is good. Their chicken fried steak is pretty good as well. They give you two decent sized steaks covered in mashed potatoes and gravy.
The bar is good as they have a great selection of beers. 
I also love their ice tea, it always hits the spot.",high
"Rula Bula gets five stars from me for two reasons:

#1 Perfect fish and chips.
#2 One of the only correctly poured Guinness drafts in AZ.

They could punch me in the neck when I walked in, and i would still give them five stars for those two reasons.

Almost all the food is good (though I can count the number of times I've had anything other than the above on one hand). The happy hour is great, with half off appetizers, including the fish nuggets, which are the fish 'n' chips I eat before I eat the fish 'n' chips.

Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but haven't found one yet!  Service is terrific!  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you don't like it sweet... order something else.  Other things we've tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat, massamum curry with chicken good... also we order everything medium to thai hot... like very spicy!",high

I've had dinner and lunch here, both times were good. For dinner, I had the special turkey sandwich with fries (fries weren't pipping hot when they were served, but still good); for the lunch visit, I had the original ""g"" spicy po-boy and chose the curry pasta salad as a side - tasty!

Service was friendly and efficient.

Update: 
12/10/07 - What's the first thing I do when I arrive in Phoenix? Punch in 2240 N. Scottsdale Road in my GPS and head to Green! This time around I had Thee Argentine Po-Boy with fried - Mock steak fried with onions and peppers, vegan mayo and a spicy sauce. I couldn't get enough! Very delicious

12/11/07 - After having a veggie burger and fries for lunch at a Hard Rock Cafe, I thought I'd balance it out by having something healthy for dinner - I ordered the Diablo Rice bowl with chicken and brown rice. The description looked good: veggies in a spicy sauce - but it was a little too salty for my taste and didn't finish it. Oh well, can't win them all.

12/12/07 - I was working close by, so decided to run in for lunch. I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich with a side of tahini coleslaw. It was a little bit messy to eat by hand, with the tomato sauce and soy mozzarella oozing everywhere - still good nonetheless. The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the sandwich.

"I still really like the Studio Movie Grill, but sat in the ""General Admission"" seats last night for the first time, and found that they were not nearly as comfortable as the ""Reserved"" seats with their own little tables.  Unfortunately.

The GA seats are also quite tightly shoved together, so if it is a full house you are bumping up against your neighbor, and it is distracting.

Best bet:  Go to a un-crowded movie and sit in one of the reserved seats that is not pre-reserved (not pre-sold, and doesn't have the little ""reserved"" sign on it) to enjoy the reserved seats at the GA price.",low

"3.5 stars. Needed a place to avoid the rain before going to see Tron with my mom at the movie theater next door. We didn't order food, just drinks. There's an OSF in Seattle, and having gone a couple times, while not super familiar with the menu, I know what they serve. Our waitress was actually really awesome- she got us our drinks quickly and was super friendly with our touristy butts. Yeah... it's a chain. I know the food isn't the best and the service can be hit or miss. But the stars are all for our waitress, whose name I (of course) can't remember. I got the OSF version of a Jack and Coke, which had a cherry infused whiskey (it was dangerous, and at 7 dollars, doubly so), and my mom got a virgin Daquiri- our waitress put extra whip on it. A little touch, but one my mom really appreciated.",high
"Things I loved: 
The Thom Kha Ta-lay (med) was creamy, spicy, and FULL of seafood and fresh kaffir leaves. The chicken satay had a nice char but was still juicy (so rare!). The cucumber and onion relish was surprisingly sweet and a great counter to the heat. 

Things I only liked:
The Pork Kwediaw Kraphrao (mint and pepper stir fry with egg noodles) was not as mediumly spiced and could have used a touch more mintyness. They were out of Pumpkin Custard, which made me very sad as it sounded awesome.

Verdict: 
I would go back to try a curry or rice dish, for sure!",high

I liked their stacks of Latin American Vogue, and the artwork on the walls was nice.  They also had ice water out for you to serve yourself. 

I ordered my usual americano, and was pleased.  They have raw sugar you can serve yourself by the heaping spoonful out of a pretty candy dish.  That was lovely.

Also, they are now the only place to carry Sweet Peas Bakery items.  My favorite thing to do was walk down to Danielle's shop downtown and pick up some coffee at Royal and some of her Rosemary Shortbread cookies.  It doesn't sound yummy, but believe me they are!  Be sure to ask for some. 

At the time I went, the place was obviously not crowded and I received attentive service...",high
"There are certain people in your life that you should have & trust. A good mechanic is high on that list. 

I found out about Whitey's Auto through twitter. Many of my friends were communicating with Scott, the GM, and I started following him too. His tweets were funny, authentic and relevant- and not always about auto repair. The most important aspect of his tweets? They're immediate.

At the time, I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didn't need to go to Whitey's for service. However, when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it, Scott responded for me to call him and he'd help me out. 

Although Whitey's doesn't do body work, their neighbor 1st Class Auto Body does. Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right. He had made me a lifelong customer at that point. 

When my boyfriend's truck kept leaking oil and he wasn't getting results at the shop he was taking it to, I took him to Whitey's and introduced him to Scott. With one check, Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for. Scott told him if he didn't mind the leak, he could put off the service work as it wasn't something imperative. And he didn't charge him for the assessment.

Recently the belts on my car fell off, causing my a/c to go out & lights to come on my dash. My warranty was over, but I didn't even hesitate. I just turned right around and took my car to Whitey's. Replacement belts and labor (plus they checked my battery and charged it for me) cost $80 less than it would have at the dealership. 

The inexpensive cost, along with piece of mind that comes with dealing with a mechanic and shop you can trust, make Whitey's irreplaceable. Don't hesitate to take your vehicle there first when you need service!",high
"I went to Gordon Biersch for a birthday party at the beginning of the month.  I had fun, but it had little to do with the establishment.  We had a special ""deal"" of $17 because we were such a big party.  There were soft drinks included in the price, but alcohol was more.  I have no issue with this, but the food was not very good.  I had a pasta dish and it was fine, but I am not dying to eat it again.  Then, we get our bills.  The price was not $17, there was additional tax and tip added on (which again is fine, but deceptive when we were told it would be $17 per person).  Then, my pregnant friend had a cranberry juice and sparkling water.  This apparently was not on the included menu and she was charged a $2 alcohol fee for her non-alcoholic beverage.  It just seemed a bit fishy to me.  Had it been an excellent meal, I wouldn't care about a few bucks, but it was just ok.",high

"If you really care about your health and want a sincere doctor who honestly cares about his patients and believes in his practice, then this is the doctor for you. I am a 40-year-old woman who couldn't be happier with the care I have received and how I feel after seeing Dr. E for the past year. I recommend Dr. E to all my friends and family and the ones who actually listen have been very happy with their care as well. 

In response to Lisa N., it is possible that you are one of the few people who is immune to Botox and similar products, which is to no fault of the doctor. I too was extremely unhappy with subsequent treatments given by another doctor only to find out that no amount of the toxin would ever be effective for me because my immune system works too well. Ironic, isn't it? 

You should always do your homework when looking for a new doctor, especially when you know exactly what type of treatment you are seeking. For example, if you are simply interested in the HCG diet program instead of overall health and you had been elsewhere for less money then likely that place is a better match for you. 

We don't live forever, but we can live better while we are here. Take control of your medical care, it's your body and therefore your decision. Dr. E at Carefree Health Path is a great place to start your empowering journey to health.",high
"When we first moved to Ocotillo the first thing we did was peruse yelp for the best local eateries. Mikado was one of the first things to splash onto our radar and we had to check it out. Luckily for us Mikado is literally a 2 minute drive from our house. :)

The restaurant is low-key and I like how the lighting is a little dimmer than usual to create a more mellow ambience. The servers are all very attentive and kind which makes the eating experience so much more enjoyable. 

So anyway, on to the sushi! I adore sushi rolls with some kind of crunch in them which is why I love anything tempura. The Big Shrimp Tempura Roll is my favorite and it could stand alone as a meal because it's so ginormous. They stuff 3 large tempura shrimp in there with avocado and cucumber then drizzle it with eel sauce. LOVE! And while I'm on the subject, Mikado has mastered the art of frying up a perfect tempura. Their tempura shrimp is super crispy, isn't greasy and always fresh out of the fryer. The Crunch Roll is superb, the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious. Their prices are great and you still get so much food. How can you go wrong? If you're within a 20 mile radius of Mikado you need to stop by.

Also, I can't say this enough: Please support your local businesses! They depend on your patronage!",high
"One word: bleh. I know my Thai food and this place was about 1 star, an extra star for the nice service. I came here with my mom, uncle, and aunt and being my first time, I opted to order my usual pad see ew. We also ordered coconut fried shrimps, the mango papaya salad, tom yum soup, and fried rice. Honestly, the best thing about our order was the coconut fried shrimps. It came out hot a crispy and flavorful. Everything else needed help. 

The fried rice was too overwhelming, it tasted like too much fish sauce and was very salty. The Tom yum soup was a little bland and we had to add fish sauce to it, and the pad see ew was way too darn spicy for being a ""mild/medium"". It was full of this unpleasant pepper flavor that I definitely wasn't use to in my pad see ew as well. My aunt and uncle think that the place hired a new head chef or something, because since they're regulars, the food this time around was definitely not worth the bill. We ended up to-going 60% of the food untouched so that we can tweak it ourselves at home to our liking.

"My boyfriend and I ended up spending a long weekend here because his grandmother had a week expiring on her timeshare with no one to use it.  So here we were!

We aren't golfers.  We came to see AZ.  We were in an interesting spot to do it ... we spent most of our time in the Superstition Mountains and Phoenix and then did one day trip into Sedona.  So from a proximity perspective, if you are interested in seeing more than just the Grand Canyon, it's a good spot.

Regarding accomodations, we really liked our little condo.  Although the furniture selection was a little random (like why have a love seat but no sofa), it was definitely adequate.  The beds were comfortable.  And we LOVED having our own private hot tub.  We discussed several times that we should maybe install one at the house!!  It was just great to get in a soak after a long day of touring.

We also really liked the restaurant on site.  There's not much to choose from in terms of eats in Apache Junction but the Kokopelli's was really nice.  I had a delicious salad with strawberries, blue cheese, and grilled chicken one night and fish over pasta the next.  Both were fabulous.  There was live music and the service was really good.  We met some super interesting people and so the conversation was flowing.  It was just a really enjoyable place to spend a night under the AZ sky!

One kind of crazy thing that happened was there was a huge mud slide that wiped out part of the golf course and filled the parking lot.  We couldn't drive into the resort for a couple of hours one evening as a result.  Luckily, they reopened the kitchen to serve us since we were late arriving.  I'm just glad we got locked out, not it!",low
"Shame on me for not writing a review sooner.  Dined here with three other friends during our Spring Training trip at the end of March. We had to make reservations about 2 months prior as well.  We arrived for our 6:30pm reservations and the place was packed! The bar was flowing, both dining areas were filled with people and the entry area was bustling. 

As we waited for our table, Muhammed Ali walked in with his wife and family members. That was a huge highlight. This place is rich with sports memorbillia and players often eat here after a game. Only odd thing was our waitress told us after that the Brewers Manager was also dining in the next room and that we could walk over there if wanted to. I am a super fan of baseball, but even I know the limits of someone's personal space. 

We each ordered a few appetizers, bottle of wine and some salads before our entrees. I ordered the 10 oz ribeye and it was delicous. We ordered a side of mac and cheese and it had lots of flavor.  This place is fun because of the sporting atmosphere, fans, players, coaches, etc. and it's walkable from Downtown Scottsdale. 

I'd definitely go back here again next year. For all the ladies, this place is a must visit for some great eye candy.",high
"First of all, I have to give Dos at least three stars just because it's Dos. I mean did going to Dos make me feel old, yes, were there some interesting people there and not in a good way, yes, did I spend more money than I wanted to, yes, but all in all you always have a great time. Nothin' but laughs. The giant jenga didn't suck either. 

Dos Gringos is a staple among the youngins, as I like to call 'em. In college, one will totally fit in, however, now'a days it's a place meant solely for people watching. And boy do you get an eye full. 

Drink's are cheap, tacos are good, and the bathrooms aren't as scary as you would think. Go! Have fun, get drunk.... but don't expect anything classy.",low
"My daughter and I really love it here.  I always walk in without an appointment and I never have to wait more than a few minutes.  The staff is very friendly, talented and professional.  Highly recommended!",high
"Ok, technically this is not Mexican food, it's spanish and puerto rican food, but has a lot of the same kinds of spices and is WAY, WAY, WAY good.

first off, they have plaintains, which look like bananas, but taste like potatoes. if you've never had them, try them here, yum! this is definitely the place to go with a big group of peole and share a few different dishes. good luck, because the menu is HUGE. the dessert menu alone has two dozen items!

seafood like ceviche and paella (supposed to be to die for), tapas, tamales, soup, salads, egg dishes (not breakfast),...the list goes on and on and that's just lunch!
plates top off around $12 for the most expensive for lunch, but you can easily make a meal out of two apps.
the mojito is their specialty, and they have i think a dozen rums to choose from, along with sangria. on the last monday of the month, every bottle of spanish wine is half off- you cork it if you don't finish it. i can't give this rest. a more glowing recommendation!",high

Not the best, but good. And the menu is great. I am a vegetarian and they have many options for us. The treats are amazing. The staff is amazing. And they always seem to play great music too. Love this place. Wish it were not so far away in Mesa...",high
"Now that this place is under new management it's gotten better.  i went once before and it was kind of nasty, now it's cleaner and has a better selection.

Its hard to find  edible chinese food in Phoenix, this one is one of the better ones now.  I think it's renamed Fuji Buffet.  It even had a sushi bar (not a sushi eater, but it had one) and everything was as fresh as can be expected. Large shrimp and chicken selection, and pizza and things for the kiddos.

Stay away from the desserts tho', not so great.",high
"I love this restaurant. Very cheap, very clean, the food is sooo good. My mom and I eat there once every couple of weeks, sometimes twice once a week. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The environment is very comforting. I recommend this place to anyone who loves cheap but tasty Mexican food.",high
"If this place only served chips and their salsa bar, I would still give it 5 stars!  As a salsa and hot sauce (they're different, people!) fanatic, I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa - and La Condesa ranks high!  Last time I was there, I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments (limes, onions, etc.).  They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa, to spicy chipotle, or creamy cilantro.  It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table, but you have to try them all! 

The horchata here is also 5-star material.  Don't be a cheapskate - shell out the $4 for it! Its giant, it will make you happy. And, when you're done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts - the drink keeps on giving! 

I have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos, 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious!  I must say I am not a huge fan of their rice and beans, which seem a bit bland to me.  But, the tacos, salsa and drinks all make up for some plain 'ol rice! 

I was very  happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that La Condesa is applying for a liquor license.  This place needs to stick around for awhile!",high
"Two stars for bad service and, damn, I have to the tell the truth, a lousy appetizer.  Had the braised leeks to start, which appeared to have been made less of leeks and more of a white cheese that I can only assume had been allowed to congeal into a rubbery mat beneath a heat lamp.  It was literally impossible to cut into bite-sized pieces, and was tasteless besides.  

Then, after at least a half an hour wait, pasta with chanterelles.  The shrooms were great, and I have to say I enjoyed fennel for the first time in my life, but the pasta was enormous in size and there was an awful lot of it.

But one of my friends had the fried green tomatoes, which were wonderful, and another had the brussell sprouts, also wonderful, and the butterscotch pudding dessert with the nutmeg whipped cream was simply divine.

They were very busy (our reserved table was 20 minutes late and the seats were still warm when we sat down), so I'm thinking they were just run off their feet.  I'd give them another chance.

Oh, and a delightful Arizona sauvignon blanc.  I'm told they serve only Arizona wines, which is kinda cool..",high
"I have been going to Physical Therapy for several weeks working on Plantar Faciatis (ripped tendons in the foot), I was not getting enough massage to make much progress, I switched to Massage N You and they focused on my calves and now we are making good progress on healing.

"Japanese chefs, top notch sashimi, affordable neighborhood sushi place! 5/5

I'd lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo! If you go to Hiro, you have to order their sashimi. We always order scallops sashimi, yellow tail, salmon, toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)! Their rolls are amazing too. All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion! Very fresh! The service is great too.",high
"Love their salad bar, so much to eat, not as much as sweet tomatoes but good nevertheless! Only suggestion would b if they can get the labels on foods, bcs for people like me who don't eat meat its very difficult to figure out that there's tuna in one of their salads without a label! I almost ate it, so I hope they take this into account! My best is the whole boiled eggs though :)",high
"I have been wanting to eat here since it opened and finally got the opportunity.  The ambiance and service is excellent, however that was not the reason why I was there.  I was there for the food that a lot of people have been raving about.

I read somewhere that the hanger steak was their specialty and I don't disagree.  I had a taste and it was indeed very tasty.  And if I go back I will definitely get it.  And at under $20 it is a steal.  However, I ordered the 8oz filet for myself.  It was cooked properly and tasted good but not memorable.  The individual sauces that you can order on the side were also nothing special.  And yes, the fries were just as everyone on Yelp said they were; good but just like In-n-Out's, but cooked a bit longer.  The sides dishes were ok at best and were a bit on the smaller side.  However, the potato gratin was amazing and better than I have had at any steak place thus far.

While it is less expensive than Mastros/City Hall, I think that for a few extra dollars it is worth going to a better place.  In my opinion, Mastros/City Hall have much better steaks and better/bigger side dishes.  However, J & G does have a better ambiance.",high
"Just because this place is called ""Maria Maria"" doesn't mean they sell Mexican food. Their menu actually says ""Mexican inspired cuisine"" which should have been my clue to leave. The food is border line Nasty!  

The restaurant is cute and sort of romantic but it's so loud in there that it ruins the ""romantic"" mood. I was excited to see they had live music until they started playing some weird pop music. Why would they do that in a ""Mexican"" restaurant?  I wanted to leave but our waitress was no where to be found 20minutes after we finished our meal.

I don't recommend this place for any meal!  

I have only been living in Scottsdale for two months but it seem that Arizona is ""Cougar"" town. The bar was full of them. I'm beyond annoyed with all this ladies acting like they are 21 wherever I go. I'm embarrassed for them. They dress and act young but with that face and hands who are they kidding besides themselves? gee.",low
I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon. I ordered a salad to go. As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didn't. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow. Very disappointed. $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers. I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website. I won't be returning here. I'll be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place.,low
"Tilted Kilt is alright. I have been here a few times and what stands out in my mind is nice decor with many tvs, good beer selection, but crappy service and food. I am really big on service, coming from the industry for over 7 years, so when I get bad service, I get in a bad mood. The girls are pretty lucky they are hot because I don't think it would fly otherwise. The fish n chips I had were not good, obviously just poured from a bag, which is disappointing. I felt the server was really flaky and inattentive, she was sitting with a group of guys pretty much the whole time, while I was waiting for my napkins, then my malt vinegar, ugh. Then she came to tell us she was going on a smoke break and I don't think I saw her after that. All in all, I can appreciate a cute girl in sexy kilts (I was actually hired to work here when they first opened) and I love me some good beers and flat screens, but I will pass on the whole dining experience.",high

"This may be fiction.  I don't know for sure.  Here's what I pretty much think happened.

The other night I was at a bar.  two days later I heard that it was Turf.  So I'm gonna go with it.  In body I was there, however my mind was suffering under an oppressive weight called alcohol that blurred pretty much every little thing that happened.

For example: did I really find myself screaming piano man at the top of my lungs, to rapturous applause from the rest of the bar?  every time I tried to stop, I was goaded forth into the next verse?  (did the piano indeed sound like a carnival?)

Was I really and truly told assuredly that I was gay?  Did I really have an argument for what felt like hours with a fair-eyed girl who has severe trust issues and one fucked up gaydar?  despite the wedding ring and total pudgy married-guy look did I still come across as gay?  (my wife tells me that it can only be the broadway rendition of a billy joel song.  I begrudgingly concede)

Did I really hear someone who claimed to be a teacher misrepresent the very definition of a parallelogram?  Did she really say that a parallelogram could not have right angles?  Did I really scoff right at her and throw down the argument-crushing example of the square (QED biatch!)?  Evidently I did, because I do remember her backing me into a corner and beating my ass with a relentless barrage of haymakers, both rights and lefts, that left me bruised like a second-rate (albeit mathematically-savvy) prizefighter the next day.  Her-110 lbs at the very most, me twice that and then some on the most gravitationally-forgiving day, and I had no response but to cower in my own fucked-up rendition of the rope-a-dope.

Her: ""flex your stomach so I can hit you.""
Me: ""Are you joking?  that's me, flexing.""  (#fat)

so I can tell you little to nothing about turf--I genuinely can't say for sure if that was the place we were at.  But since I asked right when I got there if I was allowed to yell, and the bartender said yes, yell to your heart's delight! I have to say four stars.  I would have said 5 but that looks really out of line with the rest of these reviews...",high
"This place is still open, but the name has been changed to Juba, and it is under new ownership. Same spot though, and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu. 

Anyway, I absolutely love coming here. My friend, Molly, is one of the servers, and I love her for introducing me to Ethiopian cuisine. It's definitely a very interesting blend of flavors, but now I come here about once or twice a week and stuff my face. I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel. The coffee drinks are delicious too and since they're made with Ethiopian coffee, the taste is very unique. 

If you've been hesitant about trying Ethiopian food, just get over it and go try the food at Juba. You won't be disappointed!",high
"Rental car review.

118 degrees.  Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus.  10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs.  Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses.  Finally, a bus!  We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside.  5 minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminal.

PHX...pay attention.  Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by.",low
"Stayed here one night while traveling to Phoenix for business.  What a cool hotel!  I've never stayed anywhere like this.

I didn't experience the 50's personally, but this place has really kept and captured that essence.  (And yes, it's been renovated.  This place was built in the 50's but it's not run down or anything like that.)

The room was nice, the pool looked great (never got to go...), the service was impeccable, the food at Zuzu was very good.  Old town Scottsdale is right around the corner, with great restaurants and bars.  What's not to like?",high
"Pomeroy's and I have a really ass backwards relationship. 

Typically, the purpose a bar serves me is to quench a thirst brought on by numerous factors, the most typical one being the uncanny excitement I have for making poor (but fun) decisions. Because of this, the purpose I serve bars is not only the obviously fiscal nature of the relationship, but I often serve as the harbinger of good times.

So here's the problem with P-roy's.

I never want to come here. Ever. This is the place I END UP at and it's typically the result of somebody else's negative circumstance that I don't really want to deal with (friend meltdown, death, crashed vehicles), and I almost always have to leave a place I like to come here. I know, weird, right? But I've been here more times than I can shake a stick at, and while I am usually the omen of good times to come, I always know that if I am on my way to Pomeroy's, not only will I be saving copious amounts of cashola, I also always end up having a blast and not doing something stupid. 

So the role reversal always sends me for a loop, and the bathroom always smells like fresh poop, but I can't help kinda liking it.",high
"I was toying with the idea of going on the wagon for a few weeks when I met my friend at The Mission, but the Sophia Loren cocktail caught my eye. My friend was intrigued by the Mexican Painkiller, and I couldn't let her drink alone. And oh, I'm so glad I'm such a good friend. 

The Sophia instantly made my list as one of the best cocktails I have ever had - fresh strawberries and mint muddled in rum and another liqueur I can't remember. Just sweet enough to be refreshing. And plenty strong enough to make any hour happy. This drink defines the word elixir. It is as intoxicatingly unforgettable as its namesake.",high
"Yelpers giving this place four or five stars are either seriously misguided, don't have refined pallets, or simply haven't tried Bianco or Cibo.  This place was over priced, had fairly poor service, and the pizza just wasn't that good.

I ordered the sausage pizza.  The sausage was pretty bland.  They also screwed up my order by adding onions when I didn't ask for them.  I've had my order messed up on pizzas before by having toppings left off, but never added on that I simply didn't order.  Found that strange.  I would have sent it back, but the waiter didn't check to see how everything was until about fifteen minutes after the food was brought to the table.

I'd give Humbe Pie 1.5 stars if I could, but rounded up since it is better than Dominos and Pizza Hut.  I went after buying the GroupOn coupon, but won't be returning.",high

"I am a bonafide book junkie. Libraries are my mecca. But, I'm picky. 

Getting a SPL card was a cinch. I only needed one proof of residence, although I brought the recommended three, including a Netflix envelope. 

Once I had my card, I was ready to explore. I headed first to the public computers that help you locate books... yes! With scraps of papers and mini-pencils handy, I was good to go, once I had selected a couple books to hunt down. 

So far, so good.

But then the library got tricky. Running out of the alphabet before I had found my book. Turning into another section - from Fiction to Large Print. WTF? I decided to turn this hunt into more of a tour, so I wandered the aisles, studied the names of sections and eventually re-acquainted myself with the library system. 

Don't get me wrong. This isn't rocket science. It's also not pop rocks. 

Having found my books and a couple DVDs, I proceeded to check out. Super easy, too. I can renew online? Bonus!

My first trip to the library was GREAT. 

Then the second one came. The library had NONE of the books I came looking for, and I was prepared to find AT LEAST ONE of the books on my list of 5. Nope. So I put some ""on hold"" for me and wandered about, very disappointed. That's when I began to dislike this library. None of my books? Really? 

This library isn't browsing-friendly like others I have seen. Even the ol' library in Stillwater, Oklahoma was more comfortable than this one. In fact, I miss that ol' library, with its shelves of poetry, psychology, magazines and literature... so easy to find, so easy to browse, so easy to sit for hours and read. 

I couldn't leave SPL fast enough. On my way out, a man working (volunteering?) there showed me how to use the self-service check-out system. Nice! He was a friendly ol' man, who assumed I knew NOTHING about self-service machines... and probably doubted my ability to read, for he explained step-by-step what I needed to do in order to check out my books. At least the lesson was in-depth enough for me to fully comprehend - and then some. 

So, the next time I went to SPL - to pick up the books I had put on hold (score!) - I used the self-service check-out. I was in and out in like 7.46 minutes. 

So, let's recap:
*SLP has books!
*SLP doesn't always have the books you want. (Sad face)
*You can renew online, create a profile and share reviews. 
*You can place books on-hold from any computer, if you're logged into your account.
*People working there are friendly.
*It's easy to get a card. Just bring in your SRP bill, like I did. 
*It's not an easy place to browse.
*SPL doesn't make you feel like you want to spend hours there.
*There are private rooms; just not sure how you reserve them.
*There are monthly activities at the library - but mostly about old-fart diets and how to use Microsoft Word. 
*There's FREE parking in THE SHADE! 
*You can check your items out yourself, with their self-service check-out machine. 
*It's pretty ugly inside - brown, biege, dull and lifeless.",low
"So I had this important event to attend in California and I've already spent a lot of money preparing for my trip. Earlier in the month I had received a coupon for $40 off any service at Epic salon. Wow, that is a lot of savings and I could sure use to save some money. Epic uses  Goldwell products which is my product of choice. I just needed a tint touch-up (about 1"") so I went to this salon... I had already had an awesome experience at another salon in town, but I couldn't pass up the savings by using the $40 coupon)  I was second-guessing the idea of trying a new salon since I had already found one I absolutly loved. .Again though, the coupon lured me in. Anyway, I walked away with the worst experience ever. Not only was my color wrong ( I am a golden blonde and she colored my 1' outgrowth to a 3"" ash) when I went back in to explain what was so wrong with it (5min later), the front desk lady was rude and cut me off as I was speaking to her. Not the best way to handle a pissed of lady expecially about her hair! I gave them a chance to fix it and the only thing they did was put a gold glaze on my hair, which did not help at all.  The style sucked too. I just left. I did not have time to see if they could fix it again. I will not be going back to this place for any services. Noy only because the hair experience was bad, but because the front desk gal made a bad impession of the place even worse with her nastiness. UGH! I will give this place 1 star only because on the coupon was also a savings of 30% off products.",low
"As a sissy vegetarian, I feel compelled to mention the soup that no one has yet mentioned at Da Vang - THE TAMARIND BASED SOUP HOT POT IS AMAZING!

I don't know if they use any other animal broth in it, because I am willfully ignorant of such matters.  Regardless, if you are a meat eater or a vegetarian, try the tamarind soup, and bring friends.  It is super yummy.

They also have a rice-based soup.  And, if you talk to your server, they can likely recommend some vegetarian/tofu based dishes that will be wonderful.

Everything else is as good as everyone says it is.  Wouldn't be surprised if people got an occasional bowl of sub-par pho; every family restaurant makes mistakes.  I'd recommend everyone try it again.",high
"I totally agree with L.C.'s review.  Going to XCP made college seem like a breeze.  Yes, there were the typical high school dramatics, but I feel like the teachers were able to take a harder line on discipline, since they weren't in fear of getting in hot water with the public school district.  I had an overall great experience here, and I love meeting people all over the country that have gone to Xavier.  My last flight home, the person in the seat next to me went there, and we had tons of people/things to chat about.  It's fun to see where everyone has ended up, and it is fun to get together with fellow alums for drinks here in Chicago, and when I am back home in AZ.  I think it is so sad that the girls don't get to do freshman swimming, sophomore dances, or go to dockers anymore - those were some defining moments of my XCP career.

Wait service was crap after a spring training game as they did not have nearly enough staff to serve people. Had to wait 15 minutes in a booth before anyone acknowledged us. BUZZ KILL!!

I was expecting more Island style food, or more adventurous treats.

*  Bar was great.
*  Tuna Poke thing was fantastic.
*  Cajun burger was terrific, but the bun was too dense and troublesome.
*  Chicken CocoaJoe was a bust.  Chicken a little dry and under-seasoned, rice and beans were bland (needs a giant ham-hock and about 3 more days).  The Plaintain was overflavored, but underseasoned (they don't neem much more than salt and time).

"I don't usually shop at AJ's unless I am looking for something very specific that I cannot find anywhere else. The item in the past has been canoli shells. I like to make home made canolis occassionally but I am never daring enough to make the shells. I can never find them anywhere other than AJ's. I would say that if you are looking for something special that the average grocery store doesnt have, try AJ's. They are a bit expensive though so I would go here as a last resort. Now normally, I would give this place only 3 stars, however, yesterday, I discovered their dessert counter. OMG, I was in heaven! I knew they had cakes and fruit tarts (which btw are outstanding although 30.00 apiece), however, they also have a vast array of mini gourmet desserts for when you have a major sweet craving and want something special to satisfy it. Im talking mini carrot cakes, mini fruit tarts (yes!!! I dont have to pay 30.00 whenever I want a tart from them), mini tiramisu's rounds, brownies, canoli's (WTF?) and even mini creme brulees! Additionally, they have home made chocolates which looked equally delicious. I opted for the tiramisu which was not only tantalizing but light, creamy, and honestly, one of the best Tiramisu's Ive had in awhile probably since the wine train in Napa. My best friend said that her praline chocolates were very good as well. I got a brownie for the hubby which is enormous and I will post an update once he tries it. What's even better is that the mini desserts are really reasonably priced so if you are looking for a dessert for someone to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, whatever, this is a great place to go.",high

"It has been quite the challenge to find good Chinese food in AZ. But I love this place. From the customer service to the quality of food, we are never disappointed. I am a huge fan of their fried rice and wonton soup. My 5 year old loves the sesame chicken, and their beef skewers are good. We find that the best value is either the dinner for about 19.99 or getting the food to go. For some reason, we get more to-go than eating there. But either way the quality is good. The servers remember your names and family. They are genuine provide great reasons to return. We eat there about every other week. If you want to try them, go lunch. You cannot beat their prices.",high

"I'm going to keep this one general and not too detailed; we all have to keep something private from the rest of the Yelp world, right?!

I will say that last night after the Ignite event and post Ignite event, Jared and I stopped by this Fascinations store... we were pleasantly greeted by the staff but since we were not looking for anything specific, they let us wander and be 'fascinated' by all of the sex toys, party favors, under garments, games, videos, and more... (they do have a decent selection!)

Not that I go into these types of stores often, but when I do, I like having the comfort of being with someone I am close to and/or not being harassed by the salespeople. (Yes, I'm shy, what can i say?!)  Luckily, I had both of these things during my visit last night.  We did make a few purchases, and I even tried to sneak in a package of 'nippies' since J was paying.  He caught it though, and decided to take those off of the bill (they were $14).  I thought they would be perfect for getting a nice tan line - I may have to return to make that purchase on my own!

If you're in the market for anything that you think Fascinations may carry (and believe me, if you think they do, they probably do), go pay them a visit!  Enjoy and remember to practice safe sex!",high

"Confession of a landlocked seafood lover: I'm a fan of Sakana. I know, I know, it's not the Most Perfect Sushi Ever but all things considered, the prices, variety, specials and service are far above average. I'll take it! There's a great ""Customer Appreciation"" sushi menu offered Thurs.-Sun. and though there's often a wait, it's a quick one. Don't be afraid to order an Ichiban in the lobby. They'll happily deliver.",high
"Oh Rhythm Room, how I adore thee!

I have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed.   Whenever The Rhythm Room All-stars play, I definitely try to make it.  They are rockin'.  

I dig the dancing, the bbq (mmmmmm)  and I enjoy when the f*ck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floor!

I do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair.  For bands I really want to see I get there before they open, get in line, get a table, then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start!  

I always have a great time here!  And now that you can't smoke it's even better!",high
"Very good place for breakfast & lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th & Camelback.  I kinda found this place on accident.  I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go, but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylor's, and, being closer, I opted to go there instead.  

Taylor's is open 6-4ish (I couldn't really tell, they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door), and they serve breakfast all day- well, all day they're actually open- which is always good with me.  

I was in the mood for corned beef, and , bingo, there it was.  Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese (no saurkraut or thousand island, please.).  And the bread- oh the bread- grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside.  How in the hell do they do it?  I don't know, but I'm in love.",high
"Outback is a chain resturant ~ so they have their formula perfected.  Each time we hav eaten at OUTBACK we have had a great dinner and good service.

Lately each time we try to eat at OUTBACK there has been a 20 to 30 minute wait  ~ we don't always wait . .  .but it's wonderful to know that things are picking up and that there are quality resturants that have waiting line ~ to me this is a blessings.

"This place is so cute.  To begin, it is trendy but comfortable.  The service is fantastic and the food is really good.  We were a party of six, and ordered a few appetizers (the deviled eggs were good) and for lunch, many of us did half flatbread/half salad..for a reasonable $10.  Mine was delicious.   I had a blueberry salad which was really tasty, and my margherita pizza was great.  The sun-dried tomatoes were perfect.  I will be back for sure when I'm up for drinks....a wee bit early for drinks today as we ate at 11:15.",high

"We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish and chips for the price.  However, we went back a few weeks ago and boy were we disappointed.  The price of the fish and chip dinner went up and they cut the portion in half.  No one assisted us in putting two tables together, we had to do it ourselves.  Two guests wanted a good English hot tea and they didn't brew it in advance, it was just thrown into a small metal tea pot and we had to ask for cream and sugar.  So we've decided there are newer and better places to eat fish and chips, especially up in north Phoenix.",low

This is a great dog park to have in the area.  It has a ton of room for the big dogs to run around and there are baggies and trash cans scattered all around it so you don't have to go far to pick up after your dog.  I also love that there are a couple water stations in case you don't bring your own water bowl.  The area for the small dogs looked to be a pretty decent size as well.  The only downside to this dog park is that the ground is pretty muddy so I'd recommend wearing shoes you don't care about and bringing extra towels to clean up your pup after they're done.,high
"As good as I always remember it to be.
Their fries are way better than In-n-Out (I am a fries connoisseur)

Their burgers may be getting smaller? Still delicious as ever.

I pass on the drink though, an extra $2+ makes the meal quite expensive..

Price: $9+ for the cheeseburger (double) and Regular fries

"Went here on Wednesday to take advantage of the $30 certificate. It was quite busy, which probably shouldn't of been a shock, location and all, so had to wait awhile but that is the risk of not getting reservations right? =P. 

Anyways, spent time in the bar which was nice, the bartenders were willing to answer questions, though not always the most chatty, but I think that was due more to how busy it was then not being friendly. The happy hour prices looked pretty good, $2 hot sake, $3 beer, $4-5 cocktails. Sushi was also on the cheap, Nigiri was from about 1.25-2 dollars I believe, and the other rolls ran from 3-5 dollars at the worst. They also have some non-sushi appetizers on there. 

Once we got a table, we were paired with another group, which was actually a nice experience as I do like the communal type seating stuff. Granted if you have a small group and not a fan of eating with strangers, might not like it much. 

Since it is a place I always consider more about a show then the food, going to start with that first. The show was eh, they do some of the knife play stuff, and a few things here and there, but honestly it wasn't all that exciting compared to the other place I've been (Sakura). The chef was friendly though, and the server was personable so that is a plus. Otherwise was a bit disappointed with the show portion of the meal. 

As for the food, I had the Filet Mignon and lobster tail. The filet was supposed to be medium, but came out more medium well in my opinion. It was lightly seasoned, leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else. Now it had a good beef flavor, so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally. The lobster tail was good, buttery from the butter, but more importantly nice and sweet. How it is to other lobster tails? can't really tell you as I don't eat it that much (college students don't exactly have that sort of cash you know? =P). But again thought it was good, wasn't fishy and nice and sweet. 

At the end it came with a choice of ice cream, I tried the green tea ice cream which about the same as any other green tea ice cream I've had. Basically its sweet, with a hint of green tea taste, and that is about it. 

They have to sing to you of course, and they take a picture which they give you with a code you can access for up to 60 days (I believe) to download it, which is a nice touch. 

For the money, I really wouldn't go unless I had the certificate, however I would go back for the happy hour, probably my favorite thing of the whole night.",high
Best latte ever!!!  I missed my local coffee shop in Phoenix and I stumbled upon Echo.  I am so happy I found this place.  Free Wi-fi and AMAZING lattes have won me over!  I recommend the Turkey & Brie sandwich.  The pear made the sandwich.  They have a great music selection and they don't crank up the volume.  Check this place out!,low
"Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos (an Ohio native, fyi) and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt, neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good.

Now bearing in mind that the original impetus to visit Tempe on this particular morning was to visit Caffe Boa and that Essence was more of 'pre-meal' activity what follows may seem slightly gluttonous, but to be fair once I took my first bite of Theodosopoulos's École Lenôtre trained almond croissant I knew I was in good hands and everything else just sort of followed.  Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of ""big things in small packages,"" and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.

Moving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's ""Signature"" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.

At this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later,' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.

If there were any 'misstep' on the morning, it *might* have been the ""Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding,"" though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.

Moving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the ""French Napoleon"" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see ""Mille Feuille New York"") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy, L'Arpege, or Genin and given the names I've dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essence's proximity I've no doubt I'll be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon.",high
"My absolute favorite coffee shop - I'm a regular!

"So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake. Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something. Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit. However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware, no condiments and no refills on the coffee. I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch, because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat.",low

"I would absolutely not recommend living here. I lived at these apartments for a year, and wow was the management staff a MESS. When I moved in, my mailbox was broken so I couldn't get mail for a week. They didn't give me a pool key, they gave me the wrong apartment keys, they would mix up all my information, and they just weren't very nice. I can't remember how many times they lost my work orders so I'd have to call and call to make sure things got fixed in my apartment! The neighbors were loud--I had to call the police maybe four times because they wouldn't turn down their music and I had to study for school and finals, and random people came banging on the door looking for some girl who had obviously p'd them off. The police came to my house in the middle of the night looking for her, too. One time, they gave my garage to somebody else even though I was still paying for it and when my husband came home in the evening with his pick-up full of expensive equipment, we had to wait for the cops to come and figure out whose car it was who was parked in our garage! it was a total nightmare. Shortly before I moved out new staff came in and they seemed somewhat better organized. But---I wouldn't take the chance. For the same price, you can definitely find somewhere better to live.",low

"So, for my date tonight to the Compass Room, I needed to get my nails done.  I removed my acrylics myself last week.  
I read the reviews here and decided to try DV.
You know, sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time, it's almost like the Soup Nazi.  Not this place!
There were two girls ahead of me, so I waited a bit, but only about ten minutes.  
It's bigger than the place I had been going to!  Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs!  That was nice.  Yeah, there were still speaking Vietnamese (or so I think) to each other, yes, probably about us gringas, but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations.
I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too.
She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper.
She was quick but *really* methodical.  
I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I've gotten out here in the PHX!
She even called me by name throughout the conversation.
$25 for a new full set.  Not bad at all",high

There is no denying this is great pizza,  All of the ingredients are delicately chosen and prepared by the man himself, and he manages to pull flavors out of each that should not be humanly possible.

This is a cool venue to catch a show. I actually played a show here and it was good times. They have a large dance floor or an area where people can gather to watch performers.

"I read the reviews on Charleston's and decided to take the plunge even though there were a few negative reviews. I am a visitor to AZ for business and have grown so tired of restaurant food. 

I love salad and find most places don't know how to make a decent salad, the one at Charleston's was so good with fresh tomato and egg and the creamy garlic dressing!! Yummy.

The filet was medium well and I not being a steak fan usually need some type of sauce (except for Ruth/Chris), but this steak was really good. I took my meal to go and couldn't wait to get the hotel because it smelled so good.

Last but not least was the baked potato. The salt on the outside, I quote someone else, ""genius"". 

I used curbside to go - AWESOME.

If you haven't tried this place, go - despite the few bad reviews. I am now a fan and will do something I rarely do - eat the same meal two days in a row (I am not kidding, it was good!!)",low
"I have heard so many good reviews for this place, so who wouldn't try it? I should have taken the hints before I got my meal, that this wasn't a good choice.

Hint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.

Hint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par, the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.

Hint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food, but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town, wobbly chairs, wobbly table.

I ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad, I mean who can mess up teriyaki?) With chicken fried rice (once again, how on earth can you mess up fried rice?) 

The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day. Such a horrible taste. The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out, kind of had a gross tangy after taste. There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice, just a bunch of green onion,which technically isn't a fried rice. This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.

They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie, that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu, until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.

But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce. 

So the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it, and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited, the food was great, but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had.",low

"I have lived by Wally's for years and I finally hit it up the other day ravenous for some yummy food. I expect great things from a restaurant near AJ's and the Arcadia crowd was definitely representing but I was still a tad skeptical. 
We started with the calamari which was lightly battered and not like chewing on a tire. So far - I was pleased. 
I then ordered the pesto caprese pasta which was soooo good. I'm not big on Italian food but I've always raved about it to like five people since I went two days ago. I'll go back and order the same thing - I'm so boring. 
Lots of other yummy dishes are served at Wally's such as burgers, other pasta dishes, salads that looked so good, soups, and they have daily specials like pork chops which that night came with a salad, some sides and dessert. 
They also have a good happy hour. I believe she said all apps were $6 and beers were $4. 
Wally - I'm not keen on your restaurant name but I dig your food so I will be back!

Perhaps we were... cheers!",high
"I cannot recommend Phoenix Knife House enough.  

There are very few places where you can go and physically put your hands on so many different Japanese knives, which is obviously key in any knife purchase.  If you've ever spent hours in the kitchen doing prep and chopping, blisters are a very real possibility if the knife doesn't fit.  I've discovered over the last several years of cooking at home that I prefer a lighter and bolster-less knife for high speed chopping, which ultimately led me back to PKH for a purchase.  Last year I purchased a Fujiwara 150mm petty for less than $60, and it's been a great knife; my girlfriend also likes it because it's light and maneuverable.  She bought me a Misono UX10 for my birthday, which will ultimately replace my Henckels for most uses.  Bottom line, go in, tap into Eytan's knowledge of the knives (and care and maintenance), and get better tools for the job.  It's well worth it.

I bring all my kitchen knives here to get sharpened, either by hand or on the grinding wheel.  Today I had four knives sharpened, three on the wheel, one by hand, and two with tip damage.  Total cost = $13.  

Bonus: purchases are tax free.  Highly recommended.",high

"Saw this place in the Yelp email.  Needed to take my son to Toys R Us to use a gift card and it occurred to me that Habit Burger was right there, so I suggested we have lunch there rather than the usual McD's.  I temped him with the offer of a chocolate shake.

I was amazed with the cleanliness and brightness of this place.  There was a line when we got there, but it moved quickly.  The tables were packed but we managed to snag a 2-top pretty soon after getting in line.  My son had the kids grilled cheese meal (something you don't find at your standard fast food place) and I had a charburger.  We shared his fries and the shake.

OMG - the burger was heavenly!  The roll gets a little grill to it so it has a little crunch on the inside.  It was not greasy at all, just tasty and soooo good!  The fries were equally ungreasy and good - crunchy too.  The chocolate shake - my son only had about 3 sips which left me to drink the rest of it (dang it) - was absolutely delish.  And the prices were outstanding!

Its a good thing there isn't a Habit Burger closer to my house.  I'd eat there all the time!  Five Guys?  Forget em!!!",high
"Let me start by saying I have never had BBQ I didn't like. I've had BBQ I could do without, but never that I didn't like. Went in for lunch today and I was the only customer, so I figured cool I will get good service no matter what. The girl sat me and was very pleasant and indicated my waitress would be right over. About ten minutes later, watching the waitress talk on a personal phone call at the bar the whole time, the girl who sat me came over to take the order. She walked up, didn't say a word, and just stared at me. Ok I can live with that it was only a minor inconviencence. 

Got the #4 lunch chopped pork sandwich with beans and a lemonade and it came out very quickly. Possibly because the beans were Bush's or the like? They tasted like canned baked beans heated up in a microwave. Not cool. The sandwich was ok at best. Thinking back on Stacy's, Honey Bear's, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. I'll have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary. On the way out I noticed every other table had a red sauce labeled BBQ, so I guess they have two different ones. I would have preferred the red one I assume. 

There was no atmosphere, the place was run down (doesn't appear to have been remodeled after Shish Kabob House vacated) and was generally a dirty feeling place. Seeing as they didn't have any customers at lunch time, I'm assuming the place is going to lose money today. Don't know about other days, but they better get their act together quick or it is going to fail.",high
"drove past and saw the sign, and after having spent several years in Texas, had to try this place -- and was extremely impressed. I had the moist brisket, and even without sauce, it was awesome. Nice pink smoke ring, moist and tasty. They even had the sides of dill pickles, jalapenos, and onions -- yum!

I also had the cole slaw, and it was very good as well.

I definitely want to go back and try the hot links and the turkey -- but both my friend and I really enjoyed our first (of many to come) visits.",low
"I went here this morning for breakfast with the BF to use our living social deal. We had been to black bear before about 6 years ago in glendale and then again maybe 4 years ago up in Washington state. The last time we went, we were not terribly thrilled with the place. Anyway, we decided to give them another shot and it was pretty decent. I had the shasta scramble, which has avocado, onion, bell pepper, and spinach. This was good, it was not the most flavorful scramble I have ever had, but the veggies were fresh and I liked that this was an option on their menu because most places only have one veggie scramble and it has tons of veggies thrown in with no reason for those veg to go together...anyway, the breakfast came with a ton of country potatoes which I liked more than the typical hash brown. The BF got the one biscuit and gravy breakfast and he said it was alright, not the best ever, but not bad. I thought breakfast here was better than Denny's or Ihop, but clearly not as good as the Farmhouse or Liberty Market and the like of local breakfast places. The service was also good, but I thought it was so weird because our waitress kept calling us 'kids' and calling me sweetie, princess, and honey. I find this somewhat condescending, not that I think that was her intention, but I think that is unnecessary. I know this is kind of a diner thing, but I have never really cared for us, but maybe that's just me. The waitress was good at her job and attentive though, so that is what's important.

I would probably come back here for breakfast again sometime, however, because it is decently priced and has decent flavor.",high

"This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right. I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it. Good flavor, lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious. I personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup -which is pretty freakin great.

"For some reason these self serve frozen yogurt places have popped up all over the valley and they are all very similar. What I like about this place are the choices. I usually don't have any issues, I'm a mint chocolate chip man, and that's typically what I order. My girlfriend on the other hand likes to mix it up and try new flavors and toppings. This place has the largest selection of flavors and toppings of any of the self served frozen yogurt places we've been too.

"If you're at all a ""Foodie"" you can't come to Phoenix, or anywhere within 50 miles and not visit Matt's Big Breakfast.  The wait outside is just part of the ambiance and culture of this tiny little place.  I hope they don't very enlarge this place....it would so spoil it.

Food....have anything.  Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness.  My personal fav's are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locally....changes frequently. 

This was on Diner, Drive-ins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there.

Side note...this was way cool.  On our last visit there were 4 of us, and if you've been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4.  So we're waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus, takes our orders.  When we're seated about 15 min. later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated.  Helped us get in and out and helped them move a table.  Much appreciated service.",high
"What can I say... we eat here once a week for lunch cuz we can walk here. We come here for happy hour twice a week cuz we can walk here. 

So, yeah it's pretty convenient... but we STAY here after hours to play poker because the servers know us by name and the food is priced right and the poker crowd is really cool and it's a great place to eat-n-learn.

And we LOVE Tony because that guy says hello to EVERY CUSTOMER EVERY TIME. 

Trust me on this one... jump off the freeway for happy hour... you'll know what I mean when Tony says hello to you, too.

"Delicious food and excellent staff make this small French restaurant worthy of five stars. We began with a glass of fabulous wine that we brought (it is byob) and ordered the onion tart as an appetizer. The taste of the leeks coupled with the cheese, buttery and flaky pastry made this one of the most tasty ways to start a meal. I ordered the marinated chicken. This dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite, time and time again. My girlfriend got the filet, which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes. For dessert we ordered the tart of the day, which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbread-tasting tart. Just delicious. The service was wonderful, very efficient and friendly. It is not cheap, it was $99 for the appetizer, two entrees and dessert...but for the experience and the exquisite flavors, I will go back for any special occasion... guaranteed.",high
Anyone who tells you this place isn't amazing is cu cu for coco puffs. The owners are equally amazing. They will remember you and tell you amazing stories and the cocktails are always amazing. My favorite is the lychejito made from lychee infused vodka made in house. The spring roll bar is amazing and they always change it up for me if I ask for substitutions. There really isn't anything on the menu that isn't good they offer everything from Vietnamese sammies to amazing clay pots. I always go for the soup but that hasn't stopped me from trying everything else. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Their happy hour is awesome as well.,high

The steak fajitas are so good my mouth is watering as I type this.  They give you several salsas with your meal and my favorite is the chipotle style creamy sauce that comes with the fajita.  This is the stuff that dreams are made of.  

Also their guacamole is so good and fresh.  Love the salsas as well!  Everything else on the menu, though is a little off.  Don't bother with the mole, it was just gross.

Very cool decor and sometimes they have live guitar.  Very classy Mexican restaurant.  Go for the steak fajita, guacamole and salsa.",low

"Troy, the owner, is a brilliant businessman! Being a pharmacist myself, I am familiar with the quality of his products and his facility. Trust me when I say his sterile compounding areas are more advanced than many hospitals in the Valley.

After spending a day at his old facility when I was still training, I felt comfortable enough to send my mother to Troy so that he could help her with hormone replacement therapy. The docs around town trust him enough to let him dictate what a patient needs; they simply sign off on his recommendations. My mom has had a huge increase in her quality of life since seeing Troy, and I feel the compounded HRT is safer than the Prempro she used to take.

Do not hesitate to consult a compounding pharmacist if you're having health issues that aren't being adequately addressed. Troy is one of the best in the Valley. It's worth the drive to consult with him, and further prescriptions can be mailed to your home.",high
"This review is specifically for my experience at Trader Vic's last night (a Saturday night) for Happy Hour (4pm - 7pm).

My wife and I and two friends had a great time!  We spent the Happy Hour in their outdoor bar area - so cool - which is slightly shaded and very calming.  The apps were tasty, especially for their low, low prices, and my wife really liked her  vodka cocktail on special.  They didn't have any beers on special, but I had a draft Stella anyway.

Neither of us cared much for the fried calamari, but it wasn't bad, just not our style.  Everything else - the edamame, mini-burger, and sweet potato fries - was awesome.  Oh, and speaking of awesome, so was the service.  The waitress was friendly and helpful, and the bussers were very attentive!

We will be back for Saturday's Happy Hour again soon.",high
"Q: How many people and how many minutes does it take to make a ""toasty"" sub?
A: At Quiznos?  A LOT.

The food is decent, especially the tuna melt, and $5 for a large is a great deal.  But this place is SO incredibly slow, every time I go there I swear it's the last time.  Alas, living across the street from it I have caved and gone back a few times...  But seriously, don't come here if you've got groceries in the trunk, kids waiting in the car, or anywhere you need to be in the next hour.  

Also: I can't stand the oregano powder crap they dump on every sub.  Come on, Quiznos, there's gotta be a better-tasting distinctive touch.  I always tell them to leave this stuff off, and half the time they put it on anyway. 

FYI - once the sandwich is out of the toasting machine, toppings are available by request only.  No one's gonna ask what you want on it like at Subway.  You really have to speak up if you want onions, olives, or whatever else they've got hiding back there.

Please God grant me the willpower to stop coming back to this Quiznos!!!!!!",high

"Good food, nothing super delicious that makes me have cravings. I haven't been here in a long time, as in when the fries didn't come with the burgers (you had to order them as a side item). However, now they do come with them and are still endless, but I did notice the burger prices went up to allow for the burgers to now come with fries...something that is always expected at any burger joint. They do have sweet potato fries that you can order, big plus. 

Service has always been great, they are really quick with getting drink orders in and served to you. I've ordered a bunch of items from salads to fish tacos, and of course, their burgers. Everything has tasted decent and I'm not really sure what qualifies as having ""Fine Burgers"" in a restaurant title, but I don't think Islands has it. The restaurant itself is very clean and the bathrooms are well kept. The only downside is the acoustics in this place. It can get very loud when its busy and almost annoyingly loud when there are a few kids in the joint.",high
"I think for my sesquicentennial review, I've gotten to a point where I'm letting the food direct the show of stars. Sure, we have the servers and cooks as producers, the location as our stage, lighting, sound and supporting staff. But the meal, ah, that is our celebrated lead actor. Without it, all other pieces may paint a pretty picture, but what good is a painting when it medium is missing? 

The Mission really delivers its lines well. Almost too well. Like Dakota Fanning well. Each plate has a spectrum of flavors--bold and smoky with subtle and delicate undertones of fresh herbs. Each dish is skillfully plated and ready for its closeup. My steak tacos were so intensely flavored, I didn't really dwell on the fact there were but three petite tortilla shells mounded with strips of magnificently grilled flank steak and slices of fresh avocado. And the papas y chorizo, which I ordered as an accompaniment, helped balance the palate yet was still a strong item on its own. Robert M's pozole was as unique as it was flavorful, delicious, satisfying and, ironically, humble. The bread pudding he ordered at the end of meal was, according to him, a premature ejaculation. Apparently, that means it was good, so I'll take his word for that. Those who joined us for this meal seemed to share some of the enthusiasm over the dessert, but I don't eat sweets so will have to believe their accolades worthy. 

What, pray tell, denies The Mission of the much clamored five-star rating? Primarily, it's the associated fees. On one hand, I was blown away by the sensuous flavors apparent in every edible item. On the other hand, I was blown away upon seeing the bill (especially since I had nothing but water to drink). Does one negate the other? Perhaps. Am I at a place in my life where such a statement rings true? Not necessarily. While my initial response was, I wouldn't likely return to The Mission if it was my decision, I confess that I would, willingly, give myself back to The Mission if only for the sublime sins of doting on sustenance.",high

"There have to be some considerations made when attending Frank and Lupe's: First off, you have to understand that it's not GREAT Mexican food. That is to say, it's not real high quality, but more of what you would get at your buddies grandma's house. The second is that the service is somewhat spotty at times. You give your order to the ""waiter"", who then disappears as you are serviced throughout the nite by the ""bus boys"". Getting the check is the hardest thing there is. 

Having said all that, this place is TAST-TEE! I can't get enough of their enchilada's. If you're lucky enough to be there when they are doing their Poblano Chile enchiladas, get them! They are amazing. The chicken mole enchilada plate is also incredibly delicious. And sopapilla's??? WHERE THE HELL HAVE THESE THINGS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?!?! Drizzle some honey on these bad boys and enjoy throughout the meal.

"The service at this location is absolutely atrocious. I went to the Starbucks to get a Frappuccino, as I've done many times at this location without issue. The employee working the counter had an absolutely revolting tattoo near her collar bone and a scowl on her face. She asked me if I had a membership AFTER I had swiped my card, then said ""Too late,"" when I told her I had one.

Then, the idiot with the spiky blonde hair made me a Frappuccino that was basically brown water. I told her to make it again. She made it again, then informed me that she put extra shots of chocolate in it, and I should ask for extra chocolate if I don't want it to taste like water. I have never had a problem with the way my drink tasted until that day, but apparently the problem lies with me.

I'm not the one who chose a career in customer service. If the coffee slingers at this branch can't pretend to enjoy their jobs, they should be put out on the street.",low
"Let me qualify my review by stating that I have not been to Butter & Me.  I have had their yummy mini cupcakes at a Yelp event.

I tried the red velvet mini cupcake.  It was really good.  Moist and flavorful with a rich creamy frosting.  Yum.  I chased it with few sips of Cruz tequila.  Hey, it was in my other hand.

I also tried a chocolate mini cupcake.  Yummy.  Again, moist and delicious.  I don't know how they keep the mini ones from drying out.  When I make mini muffins at home they dry out easily (that is if any survive the first half hour...the survival rate for any kind of pastry in my vicinity is exceedingly low).

I also garnered a few extra cupcakes to take back to my wife and a friend and score points.  Mini cupcakes=brownie points.",high
"I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did. We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towne.

Unfortunately, they had sold out of the oysters, but the other dishes we'd ordered were fabulous - starting with a seared tuna dish, then softshell crab roll, rainbow roll, and the green mussels. The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery ""rub,"" the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab, and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner. 

The thing I appreciated most was actually the service - we weren't rushed or hassled, and the food came out a dish at a time, giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish. At other sushi joints, I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table (and I'm not what you'd call a slow eater!). This was a happy medium for me. The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking - it's the little details that make a big difference to me.

My only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the bar...but that's what you get in Scottsdale.",high

It is great for a nice dinner with a group. The food is simply outstanding. The soup, salad, and chicken are all excellent, but the fried rice is the absolute best. I have never had better fried rice anywhere. After you have enjoyed the main course, get the green tea ice cream. I hate green tea, but for some reason, this ice cream is amazing. 

If you like teppen yaki and don't want to deal with the bland food they serve at Benihana, definitely give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed.",high
"Today was our first time eating here, so armed with great reviews from other Yelpers, we sampled a bevy of appetizers from the happy hour menu (daily from 4:30-7p) and shared a pasta entree. Of the apps, we had toasted ravioli, a platter of antipasti, and by recommendation from our lovely server, Amber, the stuffed eggplant.  The toasted ravioli was delicious-crispy and battered with a crust of parmigiana, melty cheese on the inside. A dip in the flavorful and slightly spicy marinara sauce finished it off.  

The antipasti platter serves about 2 light eaters, but for me and my spouse, it was a nice compliment to the two other shared appetizers. 

The stuffed eggplant was covered inside and out with gooey, cheesy goodness and marinara sauce.  This was to be the main portion of my meal while my husband had gorged on the appetizers, but after a taste, he started sneaking bites while I wasn't looking!  I added some chili flakes for a little heat, but It was very flavorful.  I'm not a huge melted cheese lover and would've preferred a little less cheese, but it was perfect for my husband.

The restaurant wasn't super busy when we arrived at 6pm, but by the time we left around 8pm, the main dining room and the adjoining small rooms were about 85% filled.  The prices were higher than what we normally spend, but we had been given gift cards by my brother and happened to come during happy hour, so it wasn't that bad at all. Our bill came out to about $17 without tip and we didn't order drinks.  

You do have to sit in the bar area to receive the happy hour specials, but we didn't mind.  We'll be back!",high

Food was disgusting though. I didn't have access to a car so I was pretty limited to eating hotel food for a week. Everything I ordered was gross and I tried it ALL!

"Let me preface this review by saying that for the past 2 years I have lived in Boston, which has some decent Chinese restaurants, great food, but rude/curt/abrupt service. I had learned to keep my head down, not make eye contact and not ask any questions. Eat as fast as possible and get the hell out before someone starts yelling at you!

So understandably my guard was up when I entered Mu Shu Asian Grill. However, complete opposite here. Mr Mu Shu welcomed me to his establishment, asked me if I had ever been here before and took the time to explain the stir fry/salad bar station.

I was in the mood for Mu Shu, and a place named Mu Shu must have great Mu Shu, right? Mr MS described to me his version of MS, I heard him say something about a burrito, but I really wasn't paying too much attention as I smugly thought I knew everything there was to know about Mu Shu! Boy was I wrong! When I get it, it's bigger than my forearm. It's packed full of shrimp, veggies and fried rice. Wow, what a great flavour!

"I can't even believe I actually went to this restaurant.  My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama. 

The decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.  

As it was my friend's birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good, right?  Vile, absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.    

My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Don't say ""are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?"" or ""are we ready for dessert?""  Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship, ""we"" aren't doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.  

oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.

"This club has great bands.  I saw 68 Guns and Metal Elvis here.  Also at the Metal Elvis show was a Van Halen tribute band called VH Too.  The music is top notch and it is usually not too crowded so you can go right up to the stage.  However, there are only a few tables, which is annoying if you need a place to put your drink or coat or something.  I also wish the ceilings were a bit higher.  Would be better if they could combine an indoor/outdoor area with the stage.  Overall the building seems cramped, small and old.  The prices are reasonable though.  The location is kind of strange however.  We took a cab there but when we wanted to leave we couldn't get one to come pick us up despite the staff saying they called one.  Finally we walked to a gas station and called from there.  This reminds me too much of Club Red.  Great bands, crappy club.  I hope that someone opens a brand new club for bands of this caliber.  Or else I will need to open one myself.",high

The fall months are great to sit outside and enjoy the weather to a Brat sampler.  LOVE IT!",high
"Great city atmosphere with lots of bright open windows looking out at Central Avenue.  Nice place to relax as the world rushes by outside.  Comfortable seating areas and great beverage assortment.  Danielle Librera's baked goods are the stars here as far as i'm concerned, i went in at 7 am one morning and was delighted to see the entire front counter filled with her creations (scones, muffins, fruit tarts, quiche, cookies and still warm from the oven coffeecake).  It was like a bakery buffet, danielle is right there baking away behind a corner of the counter on most mornings.  I often go to Lola in the evenings (they close at 7 most nights, so sad) and by that time of day there are only a few cookies left, so obviously the regulars are tuned into the best time of day to get the baked goodies.  A guy in front of me on my 7 am visit scooped up half a warm coffeecake to deliver home to some lucky partner/roommate.  

The morning we visited, the 7-8 am hour was peaceful and calm, a great waking up time.  It was nice to see an assortment of dads and their young 5-7 year old sons come thru the door and spend time hanging out together at the start of the day.  At 8 am the business commuter crowd started arriving in full force and the place got a whole lot more buzz from all of the conversations going on.  

Great location approx 1/2 block south of the Central/Camelback light rail stop.  Definitely worth a visit!",low
"Sam's Club is having a ground beef recall. Call the store for details.  I am just all about the FYI today! ;-)

They said they sent paper and electronic mailers - but I did not get one. I just got lucky and happen to be returning the brown ground meat that I just bought.

I am rarely able to find fresh ground meat or chicken here, but their roasts have always been fresh and very reasonable. I can get double the size here for the price I would pay (for a smaller one) at Fry's. 

And, if it is not quality meat, just return it for a 200% refund = one of the only reasons that I will try to get meat here. Although, for the hassle, it is really not worth it. 

Also, if for any reason you don't like the club itself, they will refund your membership. Look it up; it's on their website.


They are trying - but be wary of the ground meat and chicken there. It is often not very fresh. But.... I can sometime find fresh ORGANIC produce here - nothing much really - last time it was spinach. It was really cheap however, and getting organics at wholesale prices is rare.",high
"This is my favorite seafood place in Phoenix!!!! I have loved this place since it opened when I worked at Nordstrom years ago!  They have a great happy hour.  There are not many places that you can get a $5 cosmo, appletini, and lemon drop martinis...not many!!  They are not Grey Goose martini but they are delicious all the same!  They offer greta choices from their menu on their happy hour menu as well...of course they have a fabulous happy hour its because its the same owner as Roaring Fork and their happy hour is to die for...
Anyways...their menu...
The potstickers are just something different that you would not expect...and they are delicious!  I love the crab cake too!  A guilty pleasure is the bacon wrapped shrimp with goat cheese and the onion rings!! OMG!!  I cannot get enough of the lobster tacos too!!  I could just have the appetizers for dinner!  I do often!  Also, I love the Fuji Apple Salad because the candied walnuts just make you want more and more and more...the dressing just tops it all off...
Now the entrees that I love are the Crab stuffed shrimp with the vinaigrette...It is FABULOUS!!  Of course...if you love lobster tail this is the place to get it!  You get two of them!  Now make sure that it is the right season because they are not cheap, but they are so worth it!
The sides to get are the twice baked potatoes, truffled mac and cheese, and sauteed spinach!  They are fantastic!",high
"Yes, it is probably as good as it gets for a SANDWICH place. Very tasty. All 3 of us liked our different sandwiches. I also ordered pasta salad but it really was not any good, but it does not matter as i did not come there for a pasta salad. Real good besides that.",high
"Sure the place has atmosphere and a good drink menu, but I prioritize the eats. 

We went on a Monday night for a friend's birthday with a semi-large group and they did a prixe-fix menu. I left hungry after paying more than the meal deserved. 

The bad: Shumai was just ok, duck mint salad had an unharmonious flavor and I refused to eat it, chicken with wasabi sauce was dried out, lychee wrapped bacon was soggy and a strange proportion, cream and goat cheese dessert with peach was not fun. 

The good: the Hong Kong rice noodles and fried tofu with pinapple sauce were the highlights and only things I would eat again. They were really tasty. But I won't be eating them again, because I don't plan to go back. 

I'm sure there's some gems here, as we found a few, but I need a better batting average and, oh, I dunno, to leave full with a few bucks left in my wallet?",high

"I think my fellow Oreganymphos would agree; this is single handedly one of the greatest places on earth to gorge yourself with some of the most delicious pizza, pastas and desserts AZ has to offer. 

If you wanna take my word for it, dont even look at the menu and order my usual orgasmic order:

Appetizer: Calimari
Dinner: Big Rig Pasta w/ Chicken 
Dessert: White Chocolate Chip Macadamian Nut Pazookie

FYI: Whenever your taste buds feel like going on a culinary roadtrip, make sure you hit up any of the various Oregano's locations located around the state; my personal favs are the Flagstaff and Tucson locations.",high
"Best chocolate ever!  I tried Leonidas for the first time in Europe and have been looking for it ever since in AZ.  I'm so surprised they opened a store here, would recommend it in a heartbeat.  Also, staff was very friendly, a great place to get gifts!  I just got an assortment of chocolates and was very happy with my choices. The banana creme was surprisingly good and so was the champagne flavored...",high
"I finally went here, after reading the reviews and pouting about how busy I was with work and how it is hard to find someone to be my Designated Driver, since Arizona is way more strict than NJ when it comes to people drinking and driving.  

So, I finally arrived at Casey Moore's last night and was impressed.  This is an upgraded Irish pub/bar with a great beer selection, yummy yummy yummy crab cakes, and a cozy atmosphere.  

It was Thursday night in which they have a special on Kiltlifter (sp?) and I was pretty excited.  The music was not that good.  I wish that they would have a DJ there on busy THursday nights.  That would really enhance the atmosphere and probably their people traffic as well.

I vote for a DJ on Thursday nights, heck, I have amazing music, I could just be the DJ.

I will be back very soon to try their oysters and some of the other seafood dishes and of course more beer on tap.

Seriously, you need a DJ on Thursday nights.",high
"Very good place for breakfast and their pies are to die for.  We've been here about five times and they never seem to be crowded, which is a shame.  Their staff is always friendly and the food is always good.  It's like a Dennys-type place, but I think the food tastes better.  I've honestly never had a lunch or dinner item but I don't think that's what you go here for :)  The prices are very reasonable.  Once again, pies are TO DIE FOR! We've had their strawberry pie (x2), pumpkin pie, peanut butter chocolate pie and most recently, their mixed berry pie.  We're going to be moving across the valley and I'm actually a little upset this location won't be coming with us.",high
"Seriously, their happy hour prices can't be beat.  A beer, a spicy tuna roll, calamari and avocado egg roll for under $20 including tip.  Service was attentive and friendly.  We had to lurk around the bar area for awhile to get a table, but that only speaks to how popular this place is.  If you are looking for an inexpensive dinner out that doesn't involve Denny's or Olive Garden this is a great choice.",high
"As far as the sandwiches go, the place is fine but just thought I'd mention that if you are trying the broccoli-cheddar soup late in the day you may find it ""overcooked tasting"" bordering on acrid and burnt like we did.

I guess they assume everyone is going to order a $5 footlong because pricing for six-inchers is not quickly established by looking at the overhead menu.",high
"My wife and I went here and sat on the patio near the canal. The temperature was perfect for being outside and the view of Camelback was sublime. My only complaint about the seating was it was difficult to read our menus when we were there in the evening.
Our waiter was friendly and helpful.
The chicken salad sandwich I had was very good and my wife loved the burger she ordered.
All in all a very nice and relaxing Sunday evening dinner.",high
"This is a great dog park.  Plenty of grass to run around on, and there is always a good crowd to play with.  And drinking fountains and places to sit.  The majority of the dogs are nice, but there are a few Scottsdale poodles who think they are the shit and their owners just ignore their bad behavior.  I just stick my gum in their curly hair and go on with my day.

The best part of the park is when I get home and the dog takes a nice long nap, and I can do chores in peace.",high
"The two things that jettison my brain into a Barrio Cafe daydream are:

1)  The Sangrita
2)  The Churro dessert

In fact, if this place was called ""Barrio Sangrita and Churro Shop"", i would still want to run up to the building and give it a big hug.

Really, enough has been said here about the food, or atmosphere, or whatevs ... but if they're hoping to leave a legacy in Phoenix, its with these two items.

I prefer going to BC for brunch on Sunday.  I enjoy that menu the best.  Oh, and the table side Guac is a nice touch.",high
"I was told to see Greg after a local shop diagnosed my exhaust problem.  He took a few minutes to look at my car, told me what I needed and what it would cost. I went back a week later, he did the work in the time he told me it would take and there was no surprises and my car is doing well. I would recommend this place over ANY muffler shop. Plus you support local business and not a chain.",high
"I love Greek food, but I need to stop letting my friends drag me to this restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly and the place is comfortable, but for me the food is always a disappointment. I know I know, it's a chain... and maybe I just have high expectations, being that I'm from back east where we have small family-run Greek restaurants on every corner.",high
"Falafel is outstanding here, dark exterior with green interior, and a nice spicy peppery taste that is satisfying.  Cooked just right too for texture.  Fries are a nice side.  Prices reasonable here, plenty of parking, and a few atypical sodas available in the fridge.  Note that there's just a few seats inside, since this is also a grocery place.  To-go will probably be my main strategy for this great Falafel destination.",high
"I went here a couple weeks ago and got the sesame chicken.  I was disappointed when I saw that it wasn't chunks of chicken, but a boneless piece of chicken that was breaded, fried, and then sliced into strips.  The sauce wasn't that good anyway.  I won't be back.",high
"The Phoenix Art Museum was a day well spent. The atmosphere was inviting and it was like around every corner was a surprise waiting to be discovered. Admission was free for me. How you may ask? Our local library has cultural passes for various museums, try checking out your library next time you go. The museum was inexpensive adventure that took me across the world. 
 All the different exhibits kept me intrigued and interested. There were paintings, drawings, photography, and sculptures galore. There were even some animated pieces. I even stumbled upon a piece you could actually walk through. The layout of the museum is very easy to follow, as they give you a map and everything is labeled. You can go from the Asian culture, to English within a matter of feet. It is mind blowing. The whole world seems so much smaller, and it's brought together so beautifully. 
 They offer guided tours, or you can walk around by yourself. There is also a children's section to the museum. I have nothing bad to say about the museum itself. I am extremely happy that I went, and would recommend that anyone go. It would be a great date, or family day, or even a day by yourself. The Phoenix Art Museum is a place that I think everyone should visit while in Phoenix. It will really open up your eyes and make you think.",high
"I came here on the opening night when someone from Gin Blossoms played on a makeshift stage, the beers were 25 cents and there was no food (but you know me, we ordered a pizza from a neighborhood pizza place.) Since then, they have added a full kitchen and the food is amazing (chicken strips that were designed for diners who appreciate tempura-like batter and are over the age of four), the beer is astounding (one word: Kolsch...makes me swoon) and the people are great. It's worth the walk wherever you end up finding a space to park--even better, ride your bike over like we do! The Sunday brunch is great. All of my friends sit and wish they had a student loan that would enable them to spend at least half of the day drinking here daily. I don't blame them.",high
"When I think of Richardson's, I feel warm and cozy inside.  I've been on several occasions and I love the atmosphere... I always have a good time at this hidden little gem of the city.

The 'Cuisine of New Mexico' is unique... they are known for their green chile potato as well as several other pork dishes.  I usually go for the fish or seafood specials... they have a standard menu and then specials posted on chalk boards around the restaurant.

Most recently I enjoyed the blackened scallop appetizer as my entree along with a huge house salad.  The scallops were a little bit salty but cooked just right.  They were served on a tortilla with rice, beans, and a yummy spicy sauce.  Their salads are really tasty, and many of the entree specials come with a starter salad.  I went with a group of 4 and we had a couple of bottles of wine and a plain pizza as an appetizer to share.  Needless to say, none of us had room for dessert!

Be prepared for a crowd whenever you go, but enjoy your company and the people around you.  Call ahead and make a reservation if you can...  if you do have to wait, sit at the bar or by the fireplace; you can't complain once you have a drink in hand and the scent of the fire mixed with hot food and good energy.  I'll be back again soon, Richardson's!",high
"As a regular shopper of Last Chance, I must equally love The Rack. I am a cheap shopper, so Last Chance has the lower prices, but like I have said before, the product can be a bit beaten up. 

At The Rack it is a much more relaxed environment, way more organized, and the staff is so much more help full. I usually like to shop for shirts, dresses and jackets here. They also have a great selection of shoes, underwear, and pants, all a bit out of my price range though. Last week I found the greatest find! I found the best pea coat ever! It is black with double buttons and a belt, not too long and it has pockets in the perfect place. The best part, it was originally $160, their price was $59.95 AND all their wool coats we 25% off. Score! Now I will be warm in this Arizona winter. Haha 

Check them out. The parking lot can be crazy this time of year, but what parking lot isn't. There is a rumor that Santa is stationed right outside the store as well. :-)",high
"This 2 stars is extremely generous. Wanna know why? Read on.

My party of 7 and a baby got to Pappadeux's around 6:30. We were told that it would be a 30-minute wait. It ended up being more than an hour. We were standing right in front of the hostess station, yet no one ever came to give us updates on how long it would be for our table. We would go check about every 20 or so minutes. One time we were told that our table was ready. When we went to check on it after about 20 minutes we were told that they were waiting on a busboy to clean it. A few minutes later they were still waiting on a busboy. In what universe does it take a restaurant 30 minutes to find a busboy to clean a table? We watched group after group after group get seated. A group of 7 that came after us was seated before us. We ended up being sat next to them; by the time we were getting our menus, they were finishing up their meals.

Once we were finally seated, we waited almost 10 minutes before someone came to our table to introduce himself as our waiter. When he asked how we were doing, we kindly told him that we were a little frustrated because it had taken more than twice as long as we were told, and we had been told twice that they were waiting on a busboy to clean the table. The waiter said that it was a busy night and said that he didn't get paid to deal with unhappy customers. He asked, ""So are you gonna do this or what?"" WHAT?! It was so rude - I don't know how he meant it, but it came across as sounding extremely annoyed. We were appalled and my boyfriend asked to speak to a manager.

The manager came over and spoke with my boyfriend. Not sure what was said, but after that things got much better. The manager brought us an appetizer plate on the house. Our food ended up being really good - including the alligator. I got shrimp etoufee, and it was great. The gumbo wasn't so fabulous. Overall, everyone was satisfied with their meal. We got three different drinks, and they basically tasted the same: like cherry Nyquil.

The food was good, but it's not always about the food. The service was horrible. Don't think I'd ever go there again. There are too many other places with great food and equally great service.",low
Pretty good. Oxtail was awesome. Plantains were just like I remembered them in the Carribbeans. The jerk chicken was okay... Needs a little more heat. Beef patty good (I'd eat it again). The workers were outstandingly nice.,low
"I finally tried out Valle Luna on Sunday.  I must say that the food is authentic and one of the better Mexican restaurants in the Valley.  The salsa and chips are homemade and simply tasty.  I had the fish tacos that were fried and came with cabbage and soft shells - delicious.

The waitress that served me was attentive.  I must say that the seating did take a while and I was one of two people in line, hence no five star here.  The portions were decent, the tacos could have had more fish in them.

Overall I am pleased with the restaurant and you will be too.",high
"It's hard for me to rate this place because its a little run down.. but the groomers are amazing, so for Groomers- 5 Star, for actual facility-3 Star. 

I've used Janice for awhile now when she was at Fido's on Bell Road and followed her to this location.   The location is right next to Subway and is a hole in the wall by all means!  They have two groomers from what I can tell, Jennifer is the other one and my bf's dog has been groomed by her and she did a great job too.    

Why did I follow my groomer to this new place?  Well 1. Fidos Closed and 2. So many places just shave the dogs down, but Janice really takes the time to get to know what you want and takes good notes so when you come back she knows exactally what to do.  

If you are in the market for a new groomer I highly recommend making an appt with them just dont be shocked by the location!",high
"I'm not generally a fan of restaurants located within a mall, especially if it's a chain restaurant. I just don't care for the mall dining atmosphere. However, Kona Grill really surprised me! Especially the seafood. For a restaurant located in a mall... in Arizona... the seafood was awesome.

There are 3 important things you need to know about Kona Grill:

1. The Sea Bass is melt in your mouth, oh my god, foodgasm, amazing. Our waiter recommended it to us and I was highly skeptical. I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu. Well, aside from the fact that it's the priciest item at a chain restaurant, it tastes more like a 5 star dish that would cost double the amount somewhere else. I'm telling you, YOU MUST TRY IT! It has this pan seared taste that is to die for. (I also can't forget to mention that the Salmon is super tasty as well).

2. The Cool Cucumber Mojito is not only refreshing and delicious, but it is also less than 100 calories! It's pretty strong too. This drink is pure heaven for a mojito lover like me, and it gets extra bonus points since its low calorie!  

3. Happy hour!!! It's the best and it's always packed. Kona Grill has great deals with always changing specials (I suggest checking their website before heading over).

Just try at least one of these 3 things and you'll see why I'm such a fan of this place. Overall, when it comes to dining at Fashion Square Mall, Kona Grill is pretty impressive.",high
"Located in the W Hotel in Old Town Scottsdale, this hipster hangout is always busy.  I recommend a reservation if you're planning to dine here.  The Better Half and I drop in here from time to time.  Since I don't eat Sushi, I order:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=iKBiwthdGtENIqWfGK1V1A

The Chicken Skewers are very tasty.  The Teriyaki Sauce they are glazed are sweet and have the right amount of ""sour"" kick to it to balance the flavor.  The Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus is awesome...the Filet is tender and juicy and the Asparagus compliments it well.  Of course, the Chocolate Cake dessert is a nice ending for the meal.

The service can be a bit slow at times, depends on the server.  Generally speaking, it's pretty good considering how busy they are.

The people watching here is pretty good...watching all of the hipsters is hilarious.

"Well, let me start off with a look of confusion at the exceedingly rave reviews of this dining establishment. (Raised left eyebrow, and a smirk, but you already knew that)

So, initial impressions: Seemed like a confused ambience. Kind of clubish, with a little hubristic haze. The music was the only positive part, reminding me of HGTV's 'Selling New York.'

The waitstaff seemed somewhat confused, as we had 2 waiters at one point, but the bussers were top notch!

We were also sad to hear that the ""Happy hour"" menu was only in the bar.

Now to the food: The menu and the prices associated gave me a bad feeling right quick. I am too used to excellent sushi, at fair prices, as well as happy hour menus with all the favorites. (Especially dragon rolls! YUMZOID!) 

We proceeded to order a couple appetizers, and a handful of rolls. None of which were memorable in any positive light:

 The avocado roll was insipid with a strange clash of textures and flavors. (Soft avocado, and carrot sticks likeyourmompackedinyourbrownbaglunch and a strange dusting of what tasted like bread crumbs...) The spicy tuna had to be the only one that was acceptable, and it was interesting to have chunked tuna vs. the usual frappe. The softshell crab was weak, and the spicy yellow-tail was spicy, but pretty one-note, and not satisfying. 

 ***Bottom line: We decided to pay our bill, and then go straight to one of our favorite sushi spots to satisfy the sushi craving that we definitely missed out on: HIRO sushi. Man, let me tell you, I threw down a D-backs roll and a Crazy roll, and Hiro sushi was indeed the sushi Hero of the day ;)",high

"Best beer selection in Arizona but the good features end there.  It's the only reason I return and put up with the following.  Service is often horrible, even during the day when there are few patrons.  Often you have to go up to the bar to order even when there is a server in your section.  It makes no sense that a mug of beer should be empty for more than 10 minutes before it is noticed.

Food is subpar and wouldn't get such a pass from most people if this place didn't have the beer.  Prices are reasonable.  Website is often inaccurate re: what is actually on tap.",high
"I have been going to Top Shelf for almost 30 years.  I grew up eating their shredded beef burritos at the Scottsdale and Shea location which has since closed.  I don't live in Mesa, but any time I have a chance and am in the neighborhood, I stop by the Southern and Dobson location.  The shredded beef has not changed and is probably some of the best shredded beef you will find in AZ.  Their margaritas are tasty and their chips and salsa are amazing.  This is a great place for a tasty Mexican food dinner.",low

Oh, how I love Pita Jungle.  I haven't tried anything that I wouldn't have again in a heartbeat - currently I am hooked on the Potato Pizza.  yummy!

Their breakfast options are wonderful - definitely try it on a lazy Sunday morning.  There is usually no wait.

"The time was 4:30am.  It was dark and a little chilly with the sun not yet up.  Perhaps that's why they call it Black Friday, but my money was on the delicate hint of malice in the air as I stood shoulder to shoulder with  veteran soccer moms with steel and fire glinting from their eyes, Scowling teenagers and college students bubbling with nervous energy and the occasional hen-pecked dad who got talked into dealing with shopping insanity as some sort of a special treat before trudging off to the salt  mines for the day.

There were at least five hundred infantry ahead of me and five hundred behind me and our numbers kept growing.  There were scattered bits of conversation but most of us were silent, contemplating the chaos we were about to charge into for the sake of our families, our friends, our lovers.  But mostly for the sake of savings.  We glanced ahead and behind, sizing up the competition, mentally calculating our strategies for navigating the battlefield.  We were at least a battalion strong.  Perhaps a regiment by the time the doors would open.  And it would be every man woman and child for themselves.

Occasionally, someone would open a wallet or a purse, checking and rechecking their ammunition, occasionally running a finger along the edge of a bank card or bill to make sure they maintained their razor edge.  Slowly, we began to march forward and the slow but steady trudge was a stark contrast to the sense of frantic urgency that crackled in the morning air.  Not all of us could walk away victors, but all of us were determined to try.

Then something happened.  Something I would have never expected.  As we approached the double glass doors, we were greeted by another army.  With their bright blue uniforms, they could have been UN peacekeepers.  They handed us each a large plastic bag and ushered us into the store with bleary eyed smiles.  The fear and tension started to lift.  I have been at Toys R Us on Christmas eve.  I have seen the very worst of Holiday spirits and I was ready to face them again all for the sake of an (CENSORED) that (CENSORED) just had to have.

Yes the store was crowded.  But there were so many helpful, indeed cheerful sales attendants on hand that most of us shoppers just melted into a gentle wave of requests which were quickly and cheerfully met before anyone could get bent out of shape or stressed out.  A sales clerk simply asked me to wait for a moment while she located a reserve ticket for the doorbuster item I had stood in line for.  One minute and fifteen seconds later she returned with a document which guaranteed me my desired item at the desired price to be delivered to me as I left the store.  Another clerk helped me locate the other items I needed and I was done with my shopping within ten minutes.  

Of course it took another hour or so to work through the serpentine line at the checkout but all of us were so relieved at how painless and indeed bloodless the shopping experience had been. We were more than happy to stand in line waiting for the opportunity to plunk down our hard earned cash on the latest objects of technolust that had caught the eyes of our loved ones.  We left tired.  And we left poor.  But I dare say most of us left happy and for that Best Buy and the entire Best Buy army have my eternal gratitude.  Thanks for taking the ass out of Christm.",high

"I LOVE LOVE me some Joe's real bbq!!  They have the best ribs in town and their bake beans are amazing!  There's little pieces of meat mixed in with the beans and it's sooo good.  Their mac and cheese is great as well as their corn.  Pretty much everything is great here.  

The first time I went here was when I first moved out to AZ back in 2006.  My fiance took me here because he knows I'm a bbq fanatic, and I swear I though to myself, ""What is this place?  A cafeteria?"".  I did not expect the food to be any good at all.  Well, was I took quick to judge!  Taught me never to judge a book by it's covers again!  Even though you get in line, pick up a tray and order your food like you would to the lunch lady in HS, the food is the best.  They even have an outdoor seating area with trees and lights.  It makes you feel like you're at a nice park having a nice bbq.

"So, my husband and I went to to Bombero's for happy hour. Neither of us consider ourselves wine afficianados, but we know what we like. I told the server, Tim, that I wanted a heavy red, and he delivered. It was a wonderful malbec that had deep fruity flavor and a nice hint of vanilla. It went very well with the chocolate dessert that my husband and I shared. 
In the reviews, I see that many people complain about the bread and the bruscetta. I have to say that it was wonderful to have a bread with bruschetta  that did not destroy my gums after eating it. The bread was flavorful, soft and didn't feel like it just came out of a toaster oven. The toppings were very tasty, especially the Tapenade,  the Chimmichurri and the Brie with fig. 
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance, the food and not having to valet the car on Central Avenue.",high
"I'm being on the generous side in giving MEBAD (as I've seen others refer to this place) 4 stars...

It's kind of a unique gem that you don't see anymore with the owner at the register and a slamming lunch business in addition to the grocery items for sale that are rare foods, snacks, and ingredients from the Middle East.  
I suggested this place for lunch with Amy D today after reading about it on Yelp awhile back... so happy I finally made it there myself!

As Amy said in her review, we shared the baba ganoush and hummus plate and we each ordered a Greek Salad.  The salad was decent but nothing special, but the baba and hummus with the whole wheat pita was so damn tasty that we didn't even leave a bite.

The free cup of homemade daily lemonade was a perk and the owner was really sweet... and I really did like the flavor of it.  I happen to love lemonade!

I'll for sure return to MEBAD when I'm in the area to try more from their menu... this is the kind of place you want people to know about since you can tell how much work the owner and staff put into it each day.  If you haven't been, stop by... maybe I'll see you there - but please don't ask me to share my baba ganoush and hummus with you - I'm ordering my own next time!",high

"I've been a fan of La Bocca for a long time because it served the needs of an underserved demographic on Mill Avenue. Canteen offers many things that La Bocca does...and more. What is that demographic exactly? ...Late twenties, looking for something chic and classy without paying a ridiculous premium for those qualities. Mill has plenty to offer for the ASU kids and the older adults, but for those of us who lie somewhere in between, places like La Bocca and Canteen are just right. 
Canteen one ups La Bocca, in fact, because there are menu items included in happy hour (50% off most drinks and select food items). Here are the highlights:
The margarita. It's a real margarita! (It's not a lime daiquiri masquerading as margarita. Loads of sour mix does not a margarita make.)
The chips and salsa. Both fresh and delicious. The pico de gallo is particularly fresh and delicious.
 The ribs. Sweet and spicy...the level of heat from the habenero is perfect and the meat literally falls right off the bones.
The ambiance. It's chic but not pretentious. My friends and I really enjoyed the Latin music. Our suggestion would be to emphasize that music and minimize the clubby stuff (it verges on Scottsdale).
To contextualize some of the other yelper's comments. I was glad to hear that one yelper didn't find Canteen suited to his beer and Jaeger shot needs. There's a bar (or ten) down the street for that. For the yelpers that found the portions to be too small, I suspect they didn't understand the Mexican take on tapas that the taco menu is going for (in fact, the whole valley suffers from a lack of tapas locations). Finally, the service complains...my service has been cordial and attentive, even when super-busy. Folks, this place is new, let's let it go through it's growing pains before issuing such harsh judgments that might jeopardize the success of a really wonderful place.",high
"Beer is awesome (first timers must do the beer flight sampler) and I have never had a meal that wasn't excellent!   A quick note, there isn't a/c in the building so keep that in mind during the summer months - although that doesn't stop anyone from going, the place is always jumping!",high
"Was in the area for a grad school interview and the BF was craving some red meat. Came here based on yelp reviews, left pretty full, content about the food. 

Service was friendly enough, but we had some trouble communicating what we wanted. We settled on the kalbi, bulgogi and the ribeye? steak meats, with an order of the tofu soup. Everything was a-okay but I think the only thing that stood out was the ribeye. Normally we like to cook the meat ourselves but since we didnt want to stink on our plane ride back to cali, we decided to let them do it for us. Side dishes were standard with the different pickled veggies, kimchi, potato salad, etc. Waiters were pretty prompt in bringing out replacement side dishes for us.   

Since we don't know the area very well, the stars are good service, being open at odd hours (I think we got there at 4pm?) clean restaurant, decent food. -2 stars for small portions and no real wow factor.",high
"This has got to be the best barber shop I've ever been to in my 38 years on this planet.  I was always getting terrible haircuts at places like Great Clips and Hair Cuttery (when I lived in Virginia Beach), and I just assumed it was because I naturally had jacked-up hair.  After getting my first haircut from Israel (the barber, not the country), I know I'd have a hard time looking elsewhere.  I don't know if these dudes were ever in the military, but their attention to detail is top notch.",high
"There are so many good things for me to say about this place that I have no idea where to begin.

The ambiance is so amazing no matter what time of day you go. The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!) is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date. The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items). It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items. One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan. As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what ""vegan"" meant. We ended up having to call a manager over.

The cocktail menu is so interesting it's hard to decide what to get. My favorite is the Dark and Stormy, which has ginger beer. *the BEST* cocktail around IMO. Do not pass up dessert. The bananas foster is amazing! Not traditional but good in and of its own.",high
"I don't know of a single Phoenician who wasn't absolutely ecstatic about Hanny's opening.  We were all excited for this cool new ""destination.""  The husband and I were the second pair of people to walk through their doors.  There were literally hoards of employees working at the time.  There were about 15 upstairs staring at us, about 5 at the bar, and 15 or so more servers just chillin around the restaurant.  Somehow, with all these people, they managed to completely ignore us for most of our meal.  Making a typical 45 minute to 1 hour dinner experience turn into a 2 hour ordeal.

The decor of this place is beautiful.  Cool, clean, and modern.  The music fluctuates from being too loud and inappropriate for the setting to being perfect with an eclectic but well blended mix. 

The pizza is decent, but very appetizer-ish.  It is cracker thin, which turns a lot of people off, but I actually like it.  The onion strings are to die for when they aren't completely grease laden.  That's an off and on thing, not really consistent.  I don't like their sandwiches.  They are unimaginative and bland.  There really isn't a lot to choose from on the menu.

Unfortunately both times we brought friends along with us, the place was a buzz kill, and I am not really sure why.  Maybe we will try the place again now that it has been open for a while.  Hopefully Hanny's has figured out what he wants to be when he grows up.",high

"Wanted some mexican that wasn't taco bell. The hotel recommend this place. The restaurant smelled like the inside of a tomato sauce can. I was turned off almost immediately. I decided to sit on the patio and try it out anyway.

I ordered the Chipotle BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad with a light cilantro lime dressing. It was okay. The chips and salsa were okay too, nothing to brag about. The salsa tasted like it came from a can. I'm happy I ordered a salad. The redeeming factors were the Arizona Sunset Margarita and the good service. I think once restaurants turn into chains, they seem to lose their original character.",high

She lived in New York (Appropriate NYPD PIzza topic) for a few years to be close to theater, but moved back to Arizona because of lack of money.

"I enjoyed our night at Suede.  My husband I got there early and grabbed a few drinks ($4 Trump Vodka drinks- sa-weet!) and headed out to the patio.  I really liked the design of the place, especially the huge outdoor area.  Since we got there early in the night there wasn't a DJ playing yet and the only other patrons were two other young men.  As the night went on the crowd grew ever more interesting- from the undergrads that shared a table with us to the large group of 30/40 something men at the next table to what I would call here in Boston ""fashionably challenged"" girls and meathead boys.  The DJ started around 10 and man, it brought me right back to my sophomore year in college.  (Circa 2000-2001)  He was spinning all the hits from 7 years ago!  Not that I didn't enjoy my sophomore year, it was awesome, it was just not expected.   Once again, it was another place in Scottsdale where we only spent about $50 or so on drinks for the night.

All in all though I did enjoy Suede and my husband and I will definitely be returning.",high
"I found myself in Phoenix for a week. I prefer Marriott, but a co-worker insisted on Hilton....and then didn't go on the trip. Nice.

Anyway, the stay was a hodgepodge of experiences. 

Downsides: The room was nondescript on the whole, but the neck of the shower was pulled partly out of the wall and the shower curtain was partly torn and had red (?!?) mold on it. I didn't have a car, so the parking lot didn't bother me, but the area on one side of the hotel was sketchy and had a fair amount of undesirable foot traffic. The nearest station to get on the light rail was 3 blocks either way from the hotel.

Upsides: The staff was friendly and super-helpful in recommending EXCELLENT restaurants, including hole-in-wall, genuine Mexican joints. The hotel has a shuttle van that will, if you reserve it or can snag a ridealong, take you anywhere within five miles of the hotel for free, and then pick you up again. Naturally you should tip the driver (also a great guy), but it still beats taking a cab. The driver gets bonus points for letting us jump out and grab a coffee on the way to our destination! It also is only 1.5 blocks from Fez, a fantastic restaurant. 

I was not knocked out by the facility, but the people were great. I'll still probably stay a Marriott user when I return, but I'll sure consider the Garden Inn again.",low
"Went there last night with no expectations. From the beginning to the end, including the ""bread basket"" with blue cheese butter and pesto on top, the lamb chop appetizer, the sea bass entree, and the creme brulee in a flaky phillo cup lightly burnt on top, it was probably one of the best overall meals I've had in years. Thanks Eddie for stopping by our table and checking on us and chatting a bit. Very friendly wait staff and no attitude whatsoever from anybody and very comfortable. This place is a model for how it should be done.",high
"My wife and I were having a lousy day and we needed somewhere to eat. We happened to drive past Stax and decided to give it a try. Once we sat down, our moods immediately improved. Our waiter was friendly, funny and attentive, without being overbearing or annoying. I was happy to see a decent selection of beers with a healthy dose of local brews. I immediately ordered an Oak Creek Nut Brown.

Our waiter quickly brought our drinks and glasses of water with cucumber slices. The cucumber added a nice cooling touch on a hot summer day.

We ordered the sweet potato fries and I ordered a seafood burger, which on that particular day was shrimp. The sweet potato fries were excellent, fried just right and lightly seasoned with kosher salt. Even without the homemade ketchup, the fries were a delight.

My burger was tasty, with the shrimp lightly breaded and seasoned with a kicky teriyaki sauce and served on the bun with lettuce and thin strips of carrots. Also, the bun was very soft and tasty.

The only issue with Stax is the price. The burgers are more like tapas, in that they're small (3 oz). But, each burger ranges from $4 to $7, depending on the type of meat. A hungry person could easily eat three burgers, so plan to spend a decent amount of money if you want a large meal here.

Overall, a fun place to grab a lighter bite to eat.",low
"Well, apparently Netflix just wasn't down with the whole ""Extraordinarily Happy Customers"" and ""Providing Tremendous Value For The Money"" business model that I raved about in my previous review.

They're now changing their pricing structure so the One DVD At A Time ""unlimited"" package is $7.99 and the Watch Instantly unlimited package is also $7.99. So $15.98 together. They used to be $9.99 together. 

I'm keeping the ""Watch Instantly"" package for now, but the $7.99 for ""One DVD At A Time"" is just ridiculous. Yeah, they have a quick turnaround, but it's still the mail. You'd have to be a pretty hardcore movie watcher to get a better value out of an $8/month ""unlimited"" Netflix plan than just renting 8 $.99 movies at Blockbuster or Redbox. 

So yeah, I guess they're okay. The Watch Instantly service is still a decent deal. But ""One DVD at a Time"" is a total rip-off, and I never thought I'd use the word ""rip-off"" to describe Netflix.",low

"I can't really say enough about Liberty Market. The place is beautiful, comfortable, friendly and the service is awesome. I haven't had anything that I didn't like. From the wood fired pizza to the delectable salads, everything on the menu is worth every penny. For me though, it's all about the Cortadito (espresso drink) and the pastries. These are completely off the chart awesome! You simply MUST try them!

Another great plus to this place is that on just about any given day, you can visit and see Joe (the owner), hanging out, chatting with customers and all around having a great time. Joe is truly one of the nicest and most sincere people I have ever met. Makes Liberty Market all the more worth visiting.

Pholicious does a great job with their food-went their for lunch over the weekend and tried their oxtail pho which was very good.  My buddy had chicken & vegetable chow fun which was also delicious.  Sizable portions and the most unique serving of Thai iced coffee I think I've ever had.

"Shortly after I wrote my 3 star review, Christopher contacted me. He was very apologetic about our experience and wished that we had enjoyed our meal more.  He immediately offered to refund us the cost of the meal because we weren't 100% satisfied.

After discussing his offer with my friends, we decided to take a 50% refund.  Let me just say that I was personally a little uncomfortable with this because while I have received refund/free meal offers from other businesses in the past, I've never taken them up on it.  I don't think it's about the money and I certainly don't write reviews to elicit free meals.  However, since the 3 of us split the cost of the meal evenly, I felt that it would only be fair if I took my friends' suggestions into account. 

Anyway, the refund check arrived in the mail yesterday.  I decided to upgrade my review to 4 stars given the overall experience.  It's rare to find business owners who value their customers as much as Christopher.",high
"Anytime I locate a Subway with BOOTHS, I put it on my list to go!  Yeah booths!  Ok, so today after my haircut at (4 Star) Great Clips here in the center, I hopped on in here.  

The ""SUButopian"":

*  Staff a little drifty.  There was no soup on the menu sign, so I asked Mr. Drifty I, the cashier, what kinds they had today, & the price.  He said, ""We don't have soup here"".  Ok, so I asked him what was in the two kettles three feet behind him.  ""Oh.  I guess we DO have soup, but I don't know what it is, or how much.""

Miss Nondrifty appears out of nowhere, & I ask her about it.  She agrees with me that it's not on the menu, & says they have Vegetable Soup & Broccoli Cheese Soup.  Fine, but I'm a meatie!  (Ok, the Broccoli Cheese is good, but I at least wanted Chicken Noodle which almost all Subways have every day.)

After receiving my sandwich (& skipping the soup), I put my cup under the ice dispenser & it was empty!  I gripe & in a few minutes Mr. Drifty III appears & pours a bag of ice into the soda dispenser.  We're at 2 Stars right now, including a boost for the clean, comfortable cafe atmosphere & nice booth to sit in.

Ok, the good:

Backtracking to just after the no soup/soup/no soup minute, & placing my order...   The place is a little busy, but it's not too long a wait for Mr. Drifty II to go to work on my sandwich.  I order a ""Subway Melt"" which comes with ham, turkey, bacon, your choice of cheese, & whatever veggies you want on it.  

I get it on their Honey Oat bread, & have him not toast it, but just nuke the four long slices of raw bacon.  The bread gets a thin coating of mustard on one side & mayonnaise on the other.  For cheese, it gets Pepper Jack (of several good choices), then a little lettuce, lots of tomato, some onion, Greek Pepper slices, & a squirt of Ranch Dressing.

OMG, it was terrific!!  ...and the October Special is ANY foot long sub  (except 2) for only $5!

SO, while this Subway doesn't come up to the 5 Star one down the street at 5130 W. Baseline, the great sandwich & value propelled this one up to 4 Stars (& I didn't need the soup anyway)!     :-))",high
I'm usually one to prefer chicken - but when the only option for tacos is steak you go with it.  I ordered the taco and was rewarded with tender steak with lots of flavor.

Sucks, because my friends in Arizona swear by this place. I'm giving it three stars more out of courtesy to them, but my own personal experience here wasn't anything over two. The people who worked here were very friendly...  I've heard that the ceviche is the bomb diggity...

"Wildflower really is a fantastic place and I feel a bit bad giving them only 4 stars. 

Let me say up front that this is a place that I go frequently and I love. However, they have some great food and some...not so great food. 

If you like soup, try the Potato Cream Cheese.....even my husband, who's definitely not a soup fan, loved it. It's even better when you get it with the sourdough bread....it's comfort food, what can I say? Their sandwiches are mostly good. There's a few duds in there that I can't stand. I'm not a huge fan of the vegetarian one, it just tasted off to me and was a bit of a different combination of ingredients. Also, their Brie and Ham Frittata? I ended up searching around in it for the bits of ham and egg...I love brie, I just figured out I don't love it in a frittata. 

All in all, it really is a great place to go. My husband lives for the braised beef sandwich when they have it and their desserts are fantastic - you can't go wrong with anything in the magic glass case up front!

Plus, the Tempe location is right beside Changing Hands - it's like a two for one deal! :-)",high

My 8 year old really liked her charburger with cheese, but my other daughters did not like the grilled cheese at all.

"This place has to get all five stars. Ok, the area is a little suspect I will admit; that can be countered with the excellent food and excellent prices. This is the kind of food that goes for $12 - $15/plate if it were located in an upscale area.  They have done a great job with the interior and the food is really wonderful.

5 Top reasons I love La Condesa:
 ~ Beautiful food. Unique flavors. 
 ~ Great salsa bar: aver a dozen lovely hand made salsas; I liked them all
 ~ Price: you can spend under $7 and have a really good meal
 ~ Convelient: It is only a 2 minute drive from 24th & Camelback.

"Cibo is a really adorable place, but I can't say that I think it is extraordinary.  The atmosphere and ambiance is totally five star, but too much goes wrong after that to give it an overall five star.  

Food stuff:  I've been twice and both times I liked it, but it wasn't love.  We got the bruscetta plate and I wasn't really thrilled.  The traditional tomato one was the most solid choice, the bean one was strange and soggy and I don't eat pig so I can't comment on the third one (though everyone else seemed to enjoy it). The pizzas are pretty decent except that they lay out the toppings in a weird way, for example, if you order the vegetarian rosa pizza, if you like zucchini, it is all chopped up on two slices and so on.  It doesn't really make sense to top a pizza in such a way, to me.  I prefer draft beer over bottled beer, and all they offer is bottled.  I did enjoy a couple glasses of the Rossi Cabernet Sauvignon which was a solid wine choice.

Service:  The host/ess was a pleasant person, and the time quoted was less than we actually had to wait so that rocked.  While waiting, we attempted to get a drink.  The bartender was cool about getting our drinks in a timely manner despite the fact that it was busy.  Our actual server was super attentive at first and then lost for a good chunk of time as well.  Too hit or miss.

...AMAZING gelato and the coffee is just what I need! Family owned, really friendly staff, free wifi, flat screen tvs,....also just saw a flier for a monday movie night...I guess they are gonna have double features on mondays...even made a specialty drink for the night....sounds like fun!

"Really?  Because it doesn't get any better than this.  For what it is and for what it's worth this place is truly unique.  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.

What is a pasty?

A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.

At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.

Pros
* Good food
* Originality
* Portions
* Customer service
* Coat hooks at the bar

Cons
* Small interior",high
"Coming from a French family on my mom's side it is ingrained in my genes to love cooking, food, and shops like Sur La Table...oh and also wine and cheese...what a tough life I live!

Sur La Table is a classy cooking shop which offers high end cooking ware, appliances, and also dishes. Somethings in the store can be pricey, but you can also find good deals as well. They offer many cooking things you wouldn't find at your average Crate and Barrel for more complicated cooking endeavors. I have also found some cute cookie cutters here for my mom's collection. The staff was all very helpful and knowledgeable. and many Sur La Table's now offer cooking classes!",high
"Why do people love this place?  MommaKat insisted on snacking here after a hard day of shopping, and I am not impressed.  AT ALL.

I had to coerce the boy behind the counter to make a salad my way, not the normal recipe.  It was like pulling teeth.. no seriously, no cheese.  and I want this dressing not that dressing.  

We stood in line for over 20 minutes at 4pm on a Saturday.  There were 2 couples in front of us.  LAME.

There were no forks, and the cashier forgot to give me my brownie, and i thought he was going to have a conniption when I asked twice.

Bathrooms were very nice and clean though.  Outdoor seating is very limited. 

Lame excuse for a panera-",high
"Fantastic, order anything off the menu and you will be pleasantly surprised.  Best gyro I've ever had hands down and the falafel is equally amazing.  Owner paid special attention to my boyfriend and I and made sure we were happy with everything.  Only downside is that they close for a couple hours during the day before dinner time (I believe its 2:30 to 5:30 or something like that) so I can't eat their delicious food whenever I want, haha, keep on doing what you're doing Sahara.",high
"Bleh. 

I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this spot, since I frequent the other spots on the same corner.  I had some pretty high hopes that this might end up rivaling Postino's or Bomberos... or well... something other than a drive-thru.

I ordered the daily flatbread pizza.  It was a Chicken Teriyaki with prosciutto, pineapple and red jalapenos.  The ingredients didn't seem to be of the best quality.  The chicken was a little gristly (sliced breast meat would have been nice), and the cheese was unspeakable.  It was straight-from-a-bag mozzarella... which was congealed into a huge mass of grease.  The pizza was so wet with sauce and grease and heavy from too many toppings, that I couldn't even identify the crust... it was disintegrating before my eyes.  The prosciutto was all in one large clump, instead of being sprinkled throughout.  So disappointing.  My friend's caprese salad was mainly a plate of tomatoes with a garnish of cheese and a sprig of basil.  I love a good caprese - and especially enjoy when there is a fairly equal amount of all ingredients.  Helps balance out each bite, you know?  No such luck with this one! 

Our service was fine.  Helpful enough in the beginning, but I think once she sensed we weren't thrilled with our food, she just tried to get away with a minimal amount of interaction.  The waitress never asked me how my meal was... even though I was clearly picking at it, and only ate half of it.  She offered to clear it away - not box it - so, she must have realized I didn't enjoy it.

I will definitely wait a while for a return visit.  Since it is close and has a great layout/atmosphere, I am hoping that they work out these rather large kinks and become the kind of place that I would like to revisit.",high
"Let's face it, junk is the antithesis of glamorous.  When you've got a big pile of crap you need hauled away, any guy with a truck will do, right?

WRONG.  You want someone that will be on time, is willing to clean up the area where the junk is after they've picked everything up, is polite and fluent in English, thinks of value-added services like emptying your trash bin, and represents a local business that you can patronize.

Junk Guys ticked all these boxes for me.  THe guys were great and helped me out when I needed some items hauled away from a house that I had sold.  I'd highly recommend them over an unknown entity or a big corporate junk removal company.  So go get your crap hauled away by the Junk Guys - you'll thank me!",high
"I have found my new favorite sushi spot.

I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive.

You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi. 

On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven.

The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. ""Hey, fire!"" I thought. It was a nice touch.

Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe.

Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi. 

The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time.",high
A hidden gem in downtown Phoenix. I loved the design of the restaurant and was so excited to try the food. The menu isn't large at all but there is great substance in their offerings. I had the chili lime chicken which was really delicious.

"My return trip to SaBai was excellent.

I stopped in due to an irresistable craving for something with shrimp.  I was in a take out sort of mood, so as I sat at the bar the friendly owner gave me a glass of water with a cucumber slice in it.  I was pretty floored at how refreshing something so simple could be!

I quickly got my order of Garlic Shrimp (extra spicy) and headed home.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked.  So perfect that I can't think of any other shrimp to compare it to.

I was happy to see a decent crowd in the restaurant.  I know I'll be coming back again.",high

"New and big yes... but not my favorite spring training park.

5 stars for being big and roomy and also lots of grass in the outfield

2 stars for being almost like a major league park. Feels like you are attending a MLB regular season game. They lost out on the small spring training feel and intimacy.

0 stars for being the only cactus league park I visited this spring not allowing you to bring in food like candy or peanuts or sunflower seeds. You realize why when you see the pricey beer and food vendors inside.",low
"We were going to movies when the skies opened up.  

That is when we first noticed we needed new windshield wiper blades.

Kinda dumb, right?  But, the only time we use them here in the Valley is after a car wash?  Think about it.  

So we stopped at this location on Northsight, next to former site of ""Al's Beef"" which is now closed.  The folks who work there stopped me as I walked in and asked for the make and model of my car.  Within ten seconds we were over to the aisle and had the correct blades for our car.  WOW!  What a great group!

A funny aside.  As we left, I started taking out one of the blades and began throwing away the plastic and cardboard in the outside trash bin.  Another shocker.  It was filled to capacity with old blades.  Great minds, Eh?",high
"Amazing place for exceptionally good beer and time with friends! Minimal menu but great collaboration with other local vendors and ordering for delivery at their location is encouraged!

"I was initially going to give Riva's 3-stars, as they're really just like any other Filiberto's/Umberto's/Roberto's/Ernie and Berto's out there, except for a couple of small differences.

For one, everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there.  It's probably not, but it tastes like it.  And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito.

The California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.  But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries.  A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries, sour cream, cheese and guacamole for only $5?  Can't be beat, especially if you're hammered and it's 3 A.M. 

Not a classy joint, not a place you go if you're wary of stupid crap like ""health code violations"" (the best places never are), but definitely a late-night hot-spot for the Mill crowd.  Lovely.

And it's not for sissies that don't like ham in their beans either, damnit.",high
"I went in once looking for Canidae.  Which according to their website bold print they carry, but not the fine print.  They don't carry it in all of their stores.  My dog has food allergies so I'm cautious about changing her food quickly but since it was about 7 pm and I was pretty much out of food on this day, I figured some food would be better than no food.  

During my visit I learned many things.  Apparently Canidae is a inferior brand and ripped off its ingredients and packaging from Innova.  Innova is a far, far superior dog food.  Innova is awesome, Canidae is for chumps.  Innova is also more expensive and a smaller bag.  Nothing I couldn't afford but annoying none the less. Not wanting to create dog food controversy I bought a bag of the morally superior Innova.

But when I checked out I was asked about four times whether I realized I was buying nibbles instead of bits.  ""You know you have the nibbles. Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if your dog prefers bits"".

She's a 70-lb lab that will eat anything except for vegetables.  I mentioned that the nibbles were fine.

""Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if you want bits""?

Dude, just ring up the freaking food and get me the hell out of here.  As expected, my dog ate the nibbles.  She felt superior for the month supply of Innova that she ate.  Then she went back to the ghetto and ate her  inferior Canidae.",low

"Ok, these guys get five stars from me for many reasons.  Before my visit today my other experience with them was for my wedding cake.  They were very courteous and helpful, although I ended up going with a cheaper option.  Today, however, they definitely earned five stars.

I was there for a meetup event.  We got a tour of their facilities.  The owner personally did the tour, and did a great job considering I brought my toddler, who screamed through about 75% of the tour.  At the end, he gave us a cookie and thanked us for coming.

"Given the dearth of German restaurants in the greater Phx area, this is about as good as it gets.

Had the Schweizer Schnitzel as a main course.  Very good.

The meal came with a cup of soup of the day, which in this case was mushroom.  Very good.

You can't eat ambiance/decor so I generally don't care about things like that but if the owners have a spare dollar or two they may want to paint the place and replace the drop ceiling.  Neither of those things will keep me away but they may want to look into those things.",high

"The customer service at this Macy's was seriously out of this world. Both my mom and I (who were visiting from out of town; me, San Diego and her, Baltimore) have never ever experienced such friendly and helpful customer service at any department store, anywhere, EVER! We were there late at night- probably for the 2 hours right before closing on a one day sale day. In every single dept. We went (ladies dresses, ladies shoes, men's etc) EVERYONE was soooo nice and helpful. Most of our visit was in ladies dresses. Those reps did everything possible to help us find dresses in different sizes (which can definitely be challenging at the end of a season and at the end of a one day sale when things are haphazardly placed everywhere) and to call other Macy's stores when we were unsuccessful in finding a dress at that location in a particular size. Sure, they wanted a sale, but to be so helpful so late at night, right before closing, after a long one day sale was shocking. We must have encountered at least 10 different sales associates while wondering through the store and each and every one was soooo nice and helpful. The selection (at least in women's) was better than most other Macy's I've been to, to boot. 

I wish this was my local Macy's! Go here- hopefully your experience is just as good as mine :)",high

"I have been dying to go here since a coworker's spouse is one of the chefs. We finally went  last night  before the Symphony and it was a very good dining experience. The food came impossibly fast. The shrimp and Sausage Po Boy sliders were heavenly. The bread is this roll type of joy like break back east. Yum. You know the type of bread you can't find in AZ or west of the Rockies as Al Pacino would say-lol!They also served the bread basket with a veggie type of garnish if mixed with butter and put on the bread it had a very pleasing taste to it. Innovative menu- Lobster Potpie and Duck Quesadillas. HMMMMMM! Interesting. I had a side of Mac and cheese which is what I had heard about for so long and a Caprese Salad. My friend had divine Salmon. I am not a Salmon fan but i tasted it and it was yummers. My Ice tea was tasty and my friend had  a Basil Mojito that was mixed well. I don't like them usually because they are so strong mouthwashy tasting, but this had a nice blend to it. The restaurant decor is beautiful.We did not get desert but I want to go back and try those Seasalt sticks. All in all I loved going here.

"This isn't your typical Mexican restaurant that puts cheese and sour cream on everything. The food here is light, simple, and fresh. We started out with the guacamole which was amazing. My sister doesn't even like mandarin oranges but it tasted so good in the guacamole she was eating it like it was going out of style. The salsa that came with it was the bomb. One was a spicy red salsa and the other one was a tomatillo salsa. The green one was so good I wanted to drink it. I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my sister ordered a couple of tacos with rice and beans. Everything tasted great and I even had room for dessert after my meal. We had some kind of carmel, banana, crepe thing. It doesn't look like much but it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Gallo Blanco is my new obsession.",high
"I agree with Rachel C. & Luciana L. on the parking situation and the logistics of the whole place.  Although I will probably go again because my kids do enjoy it and I was able to get the last paid parking spot (at 11am).  I have been to this event and others in downtown Glendale and they can't handle the volume of people that go to these things.  Downtown Glendale is similar to downtown Scottsdale but 1/10th the size and capacity.  There are tons of little shops in a historic district with ONE parking garage and whats worse is you will pass many empty lots that they pay cops to stand around just to make sure you dont park there.  I finally ask a police officer where CAN we actually park.  Anyway, the event was cool with lots for the kids, it is a farmers market that sells food you would find at the fair thrown in with some chocolate vendors, jumpers and carnival type rides for the kids in separate areas that require separate tickets for each area (this was way annoying too).  Glendale could do better by putting up directories everywhere for people to know where they are, where bathrooms are, and they could spread things out and offer more space per human being (I am sure this place is stupid in the evening).  Plus they need to do something about parking, even if they build a HUGE garage and charge $20 a car at least there would be options for people who dont want to walk a mile before they walk around for miles....

All that said, we will probably go next year because we still do not know the definition of insanity.",high

"My first box of NGD arrived a few weeks and tears nearly came to my eyes as I removed the produce from the box.  I haven't seen such beautiful, fresh, well packaged produce since I was a kid (and I'm no spring chicken).  The carrots tasted like the sweet carrots I remember and the lettuce (with the dirt from the farm still fresh on the leaves) so full of flavor.  The amazing thing is that I had come to expect most organic vegetables and fruits to be less visually appealing than the chemical type but such is not the case with NGD.

The medium size box has been perfect for our little family of four.  It is delivered on our day like clockwork around 2am.  The unseen elf that drops off the goodies is nice enough to open the carton and place all the contents in our cooler so everything stays nice in this boiling cauldron we call Phoenix.  Furthermore, I live way out in Carefree/Cave Creek where we always expect to be on the list of places too far away for delivery.  Not with NGD.  It appears from the labeling they have optimized their routes so they can include many outlying areas. 

Finally, there is a gentleman named Ben that works for NGD.  He has been very helpful in making sure everything is going smoothly and that we are using the service properly.

We think NGD is a great value for organic produce delivered to your door and HIGHLY recommend NGD!",high

Now let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters. It's not a place for any pretentious behavior. The place has ""Chicken & Waffles"" in the name, OK? And that's what you're going to get. In abundance.

Cheap as hell. I had the #1, also known as KK's. Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas, thigh and mutant leg. All battered and fried to perfection. Two waffles the size of Vermont. A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side. OK, I could have done without the last part. But hey, when in a chicken & waffle place...

"We decided to try out Rudy's last night, hoping the lines wouldn't be too long since it was still 107F outside.  We lucked out!  There were only about ten people in front of us, so we felt we scored!  

I am a big fan of Texas BBQ, namely beef ribs and brisket.  I usually go for the lean brisket and light to no sauce (in true TX form).  

Last night we ordered the moist brisket ($12.98/lb), coleslaw and a turkey sandwich ($4.99) for DD.

With three fountain drinks, the price was about $21.  DH also went back and got the banana pudding and the chocolate pudding for DD and himself.  I think he spent about $6 on that.

THE FOOD:  The brisket was DELICIOUS.  It was perfectly smoked and not too fatty for my tastes.  It had a good amount of char on the outer edges, which is my favorite.  The meat stood alone on its own.  Very good sign!  I did try both the Sissy Sauce and the BBQ Sauce.  The BBQ sauce was quite good.  

The turkey was smoked, which is not my favorite, but it was pretty good.  DD ate it after making me remove the ""black edges"" off and getting her two slices of bread instead of the bun it came on.  That was fine with me because I put my brisket on the bun with some BBQ sauce and I was a happy camper.

The coleslaw was good.  It was sweet, but not too sweet.  It was crunchy and a little reminiscent of the KFC coleslaw, tbh.  

We were disappointed that they did not have any mac n cheese.  Mac n Cheese goes great with brisket!!!

DESSERTS: The chocolate pudding was yummy and had an oreo cookie crust at the bottom.  

The banana pudding was just okay.  A friend of mine gave me a recipe for banana pudding years ago that is really simple and appears to use the same ingredients, but is far superior.  I wonder if I should share it with Rudy's?!  

Overall, we will definitely get Rudy's again.  However, we will probably just order the brisket to go.  We can make the sides for a lot less and I am sure DD would prefer something other than the turkey for dinner.  

Yes, that's right, will be back.",high

I might even ask Santa for a gift card to World Market for myself!",high
"Totally agree with the rest of the reviewers about this being the usual greasy, meat-heavy Mexican restaurant with no frills, but soul-satisfying stomach-filling food. If you're on a diet or if you're the lettuce-eating, fat-free-everything types, you'd do best to steer clear of Poliberto's--everything is unabashedly huge and dripping in lard here. I wanted to get the three tacos combo, but since I'm a recent beef-eater, I couldn't stomach the description of tongue and beef head being included in the tacos. Though I figure it must be tasty :P

Anyway, I got the chicken taco and the carne asada taco and got plenty of lemon wedges and salsa. The tacos were huge. The asada was more delicious than the chicken. The chicken came topped with lettuce and shredded cheese and had a hard shell, which I was definitely not expecting, and didn't like. Other than that...Ok to eat at when you're hungry and want to save a buck.",high
"I thought it was ok, hubby thought it was spectacular.  I tried to order my standard soy vanilla latte but they were out of vanilla - to me that's like a hamburger joint being out of ketchup.

"My mother and I were actually getting out of the car to go to Streets of New York next door when she smelled the Mexican food and suggested we try Roberto's instead.  That should tell you what you need to know right there.

It's a hole in the wall place for sure, and leaves much to be desired visually, but the staff was exceptionally pleasant and the tables were clean.  If you're looking for fine dining, this isn't your place.  At $7-$10 for an entree, though, it was delicious.

Beans, rice, and chips were pretty standard, but the salsa, fish taco, and shredded beef tostada were very flavorful.  The food tastes homemade, and in this case, that's a good thing.

This place was also featured on TLC's Diners and Drive-ins show back in the day.  One of Anthem's best kept secrets.  I'll be back!",high
"After spending a combined seven years as a graduate student at ASU, imagine my dissapointment when I came to discover that there was finally decent Asian food walking distance from campus... two months after my departure for internship in San Diego. 

Dragonfly combines what I like about Vietnamese food (variety, flavor, price) with what I like about a modern, trendy restaurant (good decor, modern music, attentive servers). 

Though everything on the menu is above average, one item really stands out; cha gio cream cheese. I believe at this location it's called tiger rolls. Completely inauthentic, and I couldn't care less. DAMN they're good. When I drive in from San Diego, I often head there on my first night in town, occasionally as soon as I hit the Phoenix area, before stopping off to drop off my bags. Honestly one of the best things I've tasted anywhere. Highly highly recommend.",high

"This Chili's isn't a lot different than the one on Mill.  However, not being on Mill does have its advantages with not being full of college kids all the time.  The service is pretty good and it's crowded all that often.  You can have a quiet dinner here more than at the one on Mill.  Pretty good Chili's here.",high

"Perfect hotel for my conference travel needs.  Clean, new, great bars, close to other food options across the street, super friendly staff.  Great business traveler property.  The bed was SOOO comfortable.  Sometimes, Starwood beds can be too soft, but this was just right.  

Access to the convention center is so convenient.  Just out the door and down a block and a half.  Can't beat that in the heat!",high

"Thanks fellow yelpers for brining us to Four Peaks!  My husband and I were stuck in Phoenix for the night and needed a place for dinner.  Ironically we ended up at Four Peaks (a Vikings bar) on our way back home to Minnesota.  

My husband loves beer (brews a ton of his own) and especially enjoyed the beer sampler. Trying 10 beers for around $9, yes please!  I don't really love beer so I had a cider and it was exactly what I needed.  For dinner I had the turkey burger with fries.  The turkey burger was standard but the fries were awesome.  I think it was the beer batter.  My husband go the carne adovada and he raved.  I think he may try to convince me to fly back to Phoenix just for that dish!

The atmosphere was also great.  It was very laid back and fun to be able to sit amongst the beer being made.  

I highly recommend Four Peaks whether you are a Phoenix native or otherwise!",high
"Met Josh, the owner, last night and have to commend him on this sleek lounge. Great beer selection. Listed included a number of IPAs which gets high marks from me, including the revered DFH 90 minute. Atmosphere was sophisticated and dark. The decor had a polished charm to it, think swanky NY loft. Great service and good music for mingling with other folks looking for libations. I will be going back to this little gem.",high
"Ok first off, with the demise of Soma and the fact that Green is in Tempe.....this place is a welcome sight, and I know I'll be back. The food is excellent. However I feel that Dr Weil has has has the wool pulled over his eyes by Mr. Fox. Come one ""Anazazi Beans"" and a drink called the ""Medicine Man""? Really- as an American Indian rights advocate you'd think we'd be past this. Actually, you'd think educated white men with lots of money would be past this --but ya know. Just because Anazazi really refers to Ancestral Pueblo people who lived mainly in NM and N. AZ and means ""ancient enemy"" in Navajo so that term isn't used by nearly ANYONE anymore...means that you probaby shouldn't call your dish by that name. Other than that- I give em props for trying.

I recently had another experience there where EVERYTHING was going wrong that night, and the staff recovered....kinda. My advice, shape up if ya wanna last.",high
Great service and delicious breakfasts!,high
"My wife and I love to visit Sushi places to celebrate our anniversaries and hallmark holidays.

Originally, we dined at Akai-Hana a couple years back, and didn't have that great of an experience. We felt the food, service, and price just didn't add up. We then started to visit the Ah-So place right up the street because of their happy hour specials. We decided to give the Akai-Hana grill another chance after a terrible dining experience one night at Ah-So.

It's the only place we've been to lately. We've discovered their happy hour and reverse happy hour menus and they are great. The service has greatly improved and they have 2 sushi chef's behind the bar finally. 

If you haven't been there in a year because of a bad experience, give it a try again. The staff has improved as has the quality of food.",high
"I am a huge fan of local coffee shops with free wifi. I am also a huge fan of iced lattes. I know, how trendy of me, don't judge, I have some weird phobia about drinking hot lattes...I can't explain it...getting off track...anyway! Cartel!

I really like getting my work done here. This is a short walk away from J's place so whenever I'm in town and need to get work done, I head here.
I like the decor, I like the music they play (I don't even need to tune out with my headphones and spotify like I normally do when at coffee shops), and the coffee is pretty good. The ambience is chill and very oddly conducive to me getting things done. The staff here is really nice and friendly too.

Note: They also always have tempting pastries that one day I am sure I will break down and try. I'm nearly positive they'll be delicious.

Like the 4 stars say...

Yay! I'm a fan!",high
"Went here earlier this spring and WOW - What a way to watch spring training 
I LOVE the Giants stadium, and this is much better. It has twice as much lawn seating, the seats are wide and comfortable AND - aimed towards home plate, which didn't used to seem like a big deal but sitting in Scottsdale down the line, IT IS. 
The food there is top notch, with an amazing pizza slice 
Plus, the ability to walk around to diff fields and watch other players work out is amazing - it sucks that the Giants keep fields separate, I think every team should do such a joint complex.",high
"5/19/10

2.5 stars.

Didn't really care for the interior, and the tables outside weren't beckoning, either.  It was very antiseptic and cold indoors, with only the menu handwritten on the chalkboard, the plain-looking pastry display case (devoid of any ornamentation or even a sign of any effort in making everything inside presentable), and, what looked to me, an antique-looking espresso machine on the counter to lend decoration to the all-white interior.  It was also very noisy indoors, despite the fact that there were only a handful of people!  

Ordered the Mascarpone and fig jam on marble rye ($4) and the Lox w/ cream cheese and tomato ($8 or $9), as well as a latte, no sugar.  The coffee came in a paper cup... why?  Made me feel like she wanted me to leave.  Loved the mascarpone and fig!  (So much so, I soon acquired a jar of organic fig jam from Whole Foods, but I need to find good marble rye toast...)  The lox, however, was disappointing.  While I found the flavors palatable, I thought the lox strips were too thin (I had lox at True Foods Kitchen that were wild-caught and larger for only a couple of dollars more), and the cream cheese rectangles looked strange with its right angles (after seeing such a lovely presentation done w/ the Mascarpone and fig jam).  Made me wish I'd had two sets of the toast!

It was nice to see that they still roasted the coffee beans on-site.  I wish nothing but success to Toast, but I won't be going back-- at least not for a good long while...",high

"Decent bar food with all the servers dressed in Alice Cooper attire.  
I am being open-minded and starting this thing off with 5 stars.  

Minus one star for being a bit overpriced on the appetizer end.  I ordered onion rings at $8 per order.  Seriously, are 15 onion rings worth $8? 

Minus one star for not having any parking.  You have to park a couple of blocks away in the ghetto area to find a spot.  You will have 2-3 beggars asking you for change to and from your car.  There was a dude who wanted to wash my windows for money.  

Minus half a star for putting the gratuity on the bill and charging for it.  I hate that crap.  

Plus half a star for the waitresses who are dressed heavy metal-like wearing mid-riffs with the tramp stamp.  I always wanted to date chicks like that, but was ummm...to busy with umm....other chicks chasing me down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I just umm...you know, didnt have time for them at that point in my life.  

I better stop my review now.",high
"The best tacos in the city, amazing veggies, and indescribably great salsas. The tacos are like tapas, so you need to order two or three, but they are reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff with great art to view while waiting for your order.",high
Worked around the corner for about a year anticipating this place opening. Finally got to stop in for coffee this morning (a year later) and had a piping hot Americano and a mango-poppyseed muffin. Big fan so far! Looking forward to having coffee on the patio when it's a bit cooler.,high
"Kids eat free on Wed and now also Sundays with specific adult purchase! 

The white pizzas are fantastic!! mmmmmm. The kids get slices (as a kids meal) and the cheese ones are good, too. The seasonal salads have been wonderful--current one I think is called Strawberry Fields? it has nice greens, almond slices, strawberries, apples, cheese, and 2 different dressings. 

Got the calzone last night--not recommended. The large (I ordered a small and she made a mistake) was HUGE---large enough for about 5 or 6 people, unless everyone has a huge appetite for a lotta carbs. The dough was uncooked on the inside, and the broccoli and chicken were cold :(.  I guess that process needs some work.

At this particular location, there's always a gal that greets us and keeps calling us ""guys"" in every sentence. It's just a little weird, but the rest of the staff is great.  Again with this place, like at China King, never sure why there doesn't seem to be many people eating in. They do deliver, so maybe lots of ppl have delivery?

They do have patio seating with misters, but right now, kinda hot to eat outside. Probably lovely in the cooler weather.

Kids meals come with a small sundae, so that makes them happy.  

The fountain drinks are Pepsi. The diet pepsi tastes bad, and the diet dr pepper doesn't taste much better. They do, however, have filtered water. Your choice of filtered NYC water (tastes great!) or filtered Chandler water.

BTW this location is in the same plaza where Outback, Nordstrom Rack, Famous Footwear, SAS, etc are, so the parking is a little cramped. Not much NYPD can do about that, but it's annoying.",high
"My husband and I loved it.  The food was delicious. The ambiance very comfortable and child friendly.  I needed to dip my fries in something other than ketchup so they came over and asked what they could whip up for me. Who does that?  She brought out a yummy, very hot :) honey mustard. They should offer it on the menu.

I will say this though if you are looking for refried beans and mush on your plate this is not the mexican food for you. It reminded me of time i have spent down the coast of mexico, very wonderful. I can see them still working out a few errors but they are very quick to fix any mistake. the service i had was absolutely amazing, it was nice to see someone like the tall good looking gentlemen i had wait on me. he was funny and kept my table laughing and very informative overall, i really had a sense during my meal he wanted nothing but the best for my table. definitely somewhere i will be back too for sure, especially since im craving that taco vampiro again.",high

"I had the pleasure of visiting FBH with my fave Foodie Bear and Robert a while back. (Yeah I'm behind on reviews). All I can say is WOW. I have become a fan of FBH. We walked in to a small, clean space. You order your yummy meal at the counter and you have to be quick to grab a table! My advice, grab a table then go order. For my yummy meal I had the fry bread with beans and green chile. I was delighted to see that I could wash my guilt-ridden meal down with Big Red Cream soda...mmm.. When I bit into my fry bread it was crispy and light on the outside and nice and chewy in the middle. It was so good. I wished for a little more spice or flavor from the green chile sauce, but it still did the job. We also tried the chocolate and butter fry bread. It was so-so in my opinion, but I'm not much of a sweets person so definitely not a knock on FBH! 

I will certainly visit FBH again maybe after I do a giant work out or have been fasting for 5 days... it's just too good to eat on a regular basis!",high
"beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you don't drink tea?  really.

The crazy thing is, i'm sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill?

When I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  ""oh, is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill""

I said forget it, keep it.

i usually tip 20-30% but i'll just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.

  yeah, really worth losing a customer for?

my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water.

gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?)

$2.35 PER so now they're no different from the rest of the dim sum places.

as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers)

so in a down economy, you're supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges?

it's the chinese way i guess

back to china king for us.  sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace.

will you forgive us? haha",low
"I live down the street from Casey Moore's. I have been here a total of three times. The first time a group of us just ordered drinks, and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back. The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich. Again, it was so awful I had to send it back. I am not a picky eater, nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out. There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back. So, this place was already two for two. Alas, my husband begged me to go back once more. He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot. It was last Thursday evening, and the place was hoppin'. This time, the food was decent. Not good, but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moore's a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service. But the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress got us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes. We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by, and though she passed us quickly several times, she never even acknowledged us with a simple ""I'll be back with your orders."" When she did arrive 20 minutes later, she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology. I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us. She was very monotone and never smiled with us. I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night, but when she went to her other tables (all full of men with drinks) she suddenly lit up, laughed, and had a blast with them. It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past. But no. This was our first time meeting her. We were pleasant customers who didn't complain about the mediocre food or slow service. We were polite and left a good tip. We pride ourselves on being fun, engaging, and polite with our servers since we go out often. But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry. We live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars... It is such a shame that Casey Moore's has now given us three good reasons to never come back. And I can't find any information on their website of how to contact the manager about this, so I am left to rant here on Yelp, completely unsatisfied. Sigh...",low
"I have stopped into Copper Star on previous occasions, during street festivals, but today was the first time I came to sit and study. Man, am I a fan of this place. I am lucky that I live in a location where I have a multitude of options (Lux, Lola, Hob Nobs, SBUX, etc) but I have to say I really liked the vibe here. The music wasn't loud, the people relatively quiet and chill, and I could actually focus on what I was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me. I liked that while on a busy street (7th Ave), the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on. That added to the peace and quiet of it. Employees were nice, free wi-fi (internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop), and I enjoyed my small, mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie (both just under $7). I was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie (which was soooo good if I might say). They are open until 9pm on Sundays which is pretty cool. I have yet to use their drive through for coffee, but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to SBUX. There is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool off....you can give your dog a bath at Wag-n-Wash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee.",high
"Met for a business meeting, good happy hour menu, we had the flatbread which was great to share over our meeting with some of their house bread, which was excellent with the pesto.

The well whiskey was poured nicely and our server was nice.

Great for happy hour biz meetings on the waterfront, but only 3 tables in the bar, so you better get there early.",high
"I ordered the gyro.

THE GOOD:
1. Well spiced gyro meats, but a tad too greasy for my tastes. You also get a reasonable portion, which is always appreciated.
2. The pita bread was rather tasty as well. Slightly chewy, though.
3. Not too expensive.
4. Friendly owners.

THE BAD:
1. A little piece of tomato and a few paper-thin pieces of onions. If you love onions in your gyro, ask for some extra onions on the side.
2. Again, it's a bit greasy. Even for a gyro.

THE SO-SO:
1. The tzatziki isn't that flavorful, but I enjoy a definite garlicky presence to my tzatzik'. It was decent, but afterwards I wasn't lapping up every last bit from the little plastic container like a hungry dog.

All in all, I'll probably return if I'm in the area and crave a gyro.",high

And it's great too.  Wonderfully constructed, just enough of everything and not too much of anything.  I also had the watermelon juice (interesting, huh)?  One strange thing.... first Mexican restaurant I've ever been in that didn't have chips and salsa.  Only real downside is that the service is a bit slow.  But they're slammed and deservedly so.",high
"Every sports town should have a bar like this (just outside the arena). It's the first stop for conventioneers wandering into town (for a drink, post show). This ain't the place if you're looking for a quiet spot.. However, if you're looking for a lively and well furnished sports-bar, with attractive waitstaff, this place is great. The back room has huge leather booths. The outdoor seating is nice too--it can get a little wild after the events let loose.",high

"I've been fortunate enough to stay at several Ritz-Carlton hotels around the US... San Francisco, Amelia Island, Atlanta, Buckhead, and Lake Oconee are the ones that stand out.  I've also been to events at many of these locations and more and I've always been blown away by how beautiful these hotels are and how incredible the service has been.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the Ritz sets a standard for other hotels, and they are known for luxury!

When I recently spent the night at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, I was not as blown away... the room was just ok - nothing so special, and I don't have any major complaints but I guess with my past experience and the reputation of the Ritz in general, I expected more.  (Don't hate me, Ritz-Carlton; I'm still a fan, but maybe not so much of the Phoenix location compared to the rest).

I will say that we did get a discounted room rate because I was being honored as one of AZ's Finest and that's where the black-tie gala took place... and it was quite the event as well - we had a blast!  

I took advantage of the fitness room for a quick workout after we checked in, and it was one of the nicer hotel fitness rooms I've seen in awhile.  Unfortunately, the pool was closed for renovation during our stay, so my BF could not swim on site, but luckily they shuttled him over to the Biltmore to swim instead.

So, overall, it was a pleasant experience - I just can't bring myself to give 5 stars like I would at any of the other Ritz-Carltons I've been to... but stay tuned for my review of the Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch (which is where I'll be heading in December for a wedding) - that one looks like it may be the best one I've seen yet!",high

"Okay.. I loved this place so much when I visited last year that I planned my Besties' birthday bash here in August this year. I flew in specifically for this event. There were 10 of us at 8pm. Called to put our name on the list a few hours before as instructed. They were so unorganized it was horrible. We didnt get seated until about 10 pm and by then 2 people had left because they were starving.. By the time we were seated our service finally came together and I have to say we LOVED the unique shots and had almost every one on the menu. As for the food. The Hamachi Popper was by far my favorite. The HUGE disappointment other than the horrible service in the first 2 hours, was the elimination of the PB & Jelly roll. It was the ENTIRE reason I chose this place and they no longer have it! WTF? Had I not had 10 shots I would have been furious. Management was gracious enough to take off a couple shots from our bill for the chaos we had endured. It was appreciated. All in all we had a good time even though it took  forever to get to that point.",high
"Enter your credit card information..chose your wash type....enter wash.....ahh clean.

The automatic wash at this place is great and touch-less! I used to have to get out of my car and remove the antenna, so it wouldn't be sucked into those heavy foam sheets that touch car washes use. I never understood the point of those, but as a kid, was frightened by them. It was like your car was being engulfed and swallowed, I felt like Captain Ahab, in the belly of the white wale.   With this touch-less wash, no need to worry about antennas, mirrors, or anything else protruding from your car, or feeling like a character from classic literature. 

The prices are meh for what you get, just spend the extra 2 $ and get the 8$ wash. It gets your car super clean, and has a full dry at the end. 6$ bucks gets you no dry, and 7$ gets you a mediocre wash, that will make you say ""did I get my car washed at all?"" With the 8$ you get this special Green Foam spray stuff, and extra rinse and polish deal. This place would be 4 stars if they wash options were better, but overall it's not a bad place to get your car clean. They have vacuums and vending machines that disperse air fresheners, towels, and small bottles of armor-all...in case you are too lazy to go to AutoZone (which I am sometimes)  

My favorite car wash moment:

An unexpecting patron approaches ""change"" machine, in his attempt to get change for his 10 dollar bill, in which he plans to purchase the aforementioned green ever-green tree air freshener. He proceeds to insert said 10 bill  into machine. Clang...Clang.... like a slot machine in Vegas the change drops from the machine, as he reaches down he realized he just bought 10$ worth of wash tokens!  DOH!!!!

He proceed to swear in Spanish..as his girlfriend laughs at him.  Little did he know that this Car Wash has it's own currency, and is a sovereign nation of the United States.....",high
"Look it upsets me that you have to give even one star. 

I can read the other reviews and I have been here more than a few times but tonight it was just beyond a bad dinner. 

Yes, we were the table of 7 people at about 8pm, yes we were group at the high top tables that were pushed together. You would have to remember us because we were the table that had 1/2 of a waiter. It was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch. 

You know what sucks more than working 2 shifts? How about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts, it was so nice of the manager to let him leave, but hey how about taking the time to have someone FINISH the open orders? 

Simply the food was not good and you are over priced.

But the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job, THEY DONT CARE and that is a result of MANAGEMENT not caring.",low
"One star would be giving it a holiday gift!

For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation. Unfortunately, Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement.

My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs. They were extremely over-cooked.  There was more charcoal on the top, back and ends that was just not editable.  Once you scraped away the charcoal, on the tops, ends and the center ribs, there was one that was eatable. 

The company offered me a second chance to try their food, by giving me a complementary full slap.  Nothing had improved.
They say they smoke the ribs, but there was no odor to that effect. In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed.
Btw...the waitress at the front counter couldn't even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were. When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily, she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night. The so called ""dry-rub"" seasoning was tasteless. The BBQ sauce is major strange!

The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging. ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket, but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor.

Overall if they don't change the way they 'burn"" the ribs, run, run or drive real fast to another place.  The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it!

Honey Bears, My Mothers or even driving to Famous Dave's is well worth the trip.
Sorry to burst your bubble, I too, had high hops for a centrally located rib place.  

I'm still waiting.",low

"Thoroughly enjoyed my recent date night at Pappadeaux.  The Hubs and I have been dying to try this place out thanks to all these amazing reviews on yelp and boy are they right.  The place was packed on a Saturday night at 5pm, which is a good indication one is in for a treat.  We made a reservation just in case, since we were going to see a show later that night.  Our waiter greeted us quickly and was very friendly and upbeat.  He told us the specials and took our drink order while we looked over the huge menu.

In the end we got the lobster roll appetizer, halibut, and bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was soooo... good and very filling.  The lobster appetizer was full of flavor, especially the sauce it came with.  The halibut was cooked perfectly and the grits on the side were amazing.  We loved the bread pudding, which was HUGE for the price.  I wish there weren't as many raisins, but all in all it was great.

So glad to have found this place!  I know it's a chain, which I usually don't love, but the old-school vibe and good quality/quantity of food made up for that.  We'll be back for sure!",high
"Ruth's Chris, the only steak house I can fully endorse.  500 degree plates make the sizzle a memorable experience.  The Ahi tuna appetizer is also a must have to start the meal off right.  While every salad they have is a can't miss, I'll go there just to get the Chop Salad.",high
"I had eaten breakfast twice at the Chandler Chompies and loved it so I wanted my husband to try them.  However, we went to the Tempe location instead.  Much older restaurant (pretty worn) and it took some time for me not to be grossed out by the nasty overall smell of the place.  My breakfast wasn't half as good this time and my husband didn't like his either - just boring and not repeatable.  Hoping he'll give me another shot and we'll make the drive out to Chandler next time.",high
"I have been to this place a couple of times and so far each time has been a great experience for the most part.  The food is awesome, and the atmosphere is fun and friendly (definitely family oriented, with a lot of outdoor seating).

Out of the two times that I have been here, I have tried their fontina burger, the pesto chicken sandwich, the sweet potato fries, and the garlic fries. The burger was delicious, the chicken in the pesto chicken sandwich was cooked to perfection, and the fries were awesome (although, the garlic fries had too much garlic for my taste). 

The only downside is that this place is always packed  (or at least the two times that I have been here).  It was featured on the Food Network, so I kind of knew that it was a popular place. But the funny thing is that I thought if going at a later time for lunch and on a weekday that it wouldn't be bad, but I was wrong and the line was still out the door.  Also, I kind of wanted to try their milkshakes, but the line was way too long to get back into (sort of wish they had an express line for desserts). 

Oh, and check out their restroom for a weird/funny surprise.",high
"These are simply the BEST sandwiches and salads. If you like your food (a) locally grown; (b) freshly made; (c) organic/all natural; and (d) yummy - and who doesn't? - this is the place for you.

Now, admittedly they have something of a soup-nazi routine set up and if you walk in and don't know the drill, it can be confusing.  So pay attention:   
1.  Look at menu.
2.  Decide what you want.
3.  Wait your turn to order.
4.  Order (give your name).
5.  Wait your turn to be called to pay the other girl for the order you placed.
6.  Pay her.
7.  Wait until your food is ready.
8.  Leave with your food.

Note that there is no place to sit inside - so you can either sit outside, or, (if it is 157 degrees out that day), see if you can find a place to sit over at LUX, they are very welcoming of Pane Bianco diners. 

It's all good.",high
"This is a huge store and love that the clothes were sized.  There is a separate room for housewares and a bit messy.  Some of the housewares stuff was dirty but great deals. They were running a 50% sale on all items in the store, blue, red or white.  Own parking lot.",high

"took mom here for a visit on friday.  overall I like queen creek olive mill. I like that you can enjoy a meal or snack outside.  I like the stuffed olives and even though i didn't do the tour this time, i think that it is a great idea.  so, i have to say in general I'm a fan. 

with that said.... mom and I had lunch already but the food I did see did not look promising but we did enjoy two small gelatos ( $5.00).  I wish they offered some complimentary bread to sample the olive oils with.  Its a little difficult to find but very cute place to take your mom or friend or anyone who likes olive oil!",low

"So we decided to come back and give this place another  try and it was  a lot better than our first experience!  We had the fondue first, which was more than enough for 2 people to share.  I had the chicago dog, again and my bf had a hamburger.  The service was awesome and our waitress made sure we had more than enough wine!  Looks like Windsor has been ironing out their kinks and really making it into a cool, fun space to hang out and eat!",high
"Here is a place that we love to go with the family...We tend to remortgage the house ever time we visit but hey with the current economic crisis who doesn't???

It was a place we went all the time but lately not as often, not because the food isn't excellent but because it is quite pricey. 

The service is great, Hudson the manager is great, very friendly and always comes to say hello. He knows us by name and enjoys our friendly banter.

The pizza is VERY fresh, the place is always immaculate and I've never had a problem with the food. If you are looking for great pizza this is the place, if you are looking for cheap well I'm afraid it isn't. 

They do have a frequent stamp program and using that will save you a few bucks in the long run.",high

"Little Chicago Pizza is the best thin-crust pizza I think I've ever had. The restaurant is small, as they probably do most of their business carry-out or delivery.  We did eat in one time, and someone came right out from the kitchen to serve us, even filling our water cups from the soda fountain that was perfectly accessible for us to do ourselves.  Anywhere else I'd have expected a snotty ""the water is right there"" rather than real service.  Everybody is very friendly, even when on the phone taking orders.  Price is comparable to any other pizza spot around, but the pizza itself, if you like thin-crust, is just awesome.  Add in the great service and you have a solid pizza place for the south Scottsdale area.",high
I go to GB for the balcony and the hefeweisen.  One a warm sunny day there aren't many places I would rather relax.

"DV Nail, may I help you? YES! You can - and always well. I've been going to DV Nails for years and they're great. I've ""cheated"" on them a few times when I hear of similar nail shops in the area offering specials and mini hot stone massages with a manicure but I always end up back at DV Nail. 

Their massage chairs are wonderful - strong massagers. You actually feel like you're getting worked on. They're clean, friendly and always do a great job for the price. It's not fancy by any means and I wish they'd turn on the radio instead of the fuzzy TV but they're consistently good. They carry every Essie & OPI color and my manicures always last a long time. A manicure & pedicure is $28 total + tip. I think that's great. 

I typically request Tina or Julie - they both take their time and do great. Don't be fooled by this place... there's often a long wait. I'd recommend an appointment.",high
"If you can look past the giant Meth billboard right outside and the general uncleanliness of the entire establishment, it's pretty wonderful... especially if your intentions involve eating a whole lobster, like myself.

Gourmet House of Hong Kong has the cheapest whole lobster dishes I've ever found, anywhere. I don't mean a measly, mid-western, tourist trap restaurant kind of lobster, I mean a damn good, meaty, savory, juicy morsel of deliciousness.

It's served a number of ways, but I usually go for the black bean sauce style. Then, I eat like nobody's watching, vow to never let my boyfriend see me like this, and usually end up getting sauce on my face, clothing, table, neighbors, etc. Go messy, or go home.",high
"All I have to say is WOW! This place is EXCELLENT!   All the dishes we had were extremely fresh, authentic, and DELICIOUS!  

My favorite pot stickers EVER.  The skin is super thin, tender, not greasy, mostly steamed encased around a very light, delicate dumpling that makes me want to order 2 next time. 6 is just not enough, they are tiny, but oh so delectable! The sauce is perfectly balanced of sweet, spicy, and tangy and does not overpower the pot sticker.  It also comes with a thin airy, crispy (rice chip?) underneath the pot stickers that give it an extra texture with scallions scattered about.  MMMMMMmmmmm.

The green curry is more brothy than others than other's that I have had, but no matter...It is delicious with bits of vegetable, and whatever meat you prefer..we got chicken.  I love sopping it up with rice and trying to eat it with chopsticks.  You may need a spoon :) 

The eggplant and chicken stir fry is also fabulous.  The asian eggplants are cooked to perfection. Their sauces are spot on.  

BEST Coconut ice cream!  It is light, fluffy, icy, dreamy, pea-nutty, coconut cloud confection that makes my mouth water!  It is not sickly sweet sticky artificial coconut tasting at all...Predominant coconut flavor is not my favorite and I LOVE THIS! 

Even if you don't like curries, there is plenty of food here that will make you a fan!  This is a mom and pop kind of place, they are really nice.  It's a trek for us, but definitely worth the drive!",high
"All I'm saying is they need to do a better job at hiring their staff. The girl that helped us out last time was on something pretty heavy. It was a school night, and we had just finished up dinner next door at Windsor. We all wanted to get something sweet, but the girl working there was so blitzed out of her mind on something. She was barely able to interact with us. Within the first 2 minutes she must have asked us 5 times how we were doing. She never once made eye contact.  I'm not exaggerating by saying she looked pretty filthy, and was really rude to boot. Maybe that's just how the poor girl is, but damn, you think they could do a better job hiring people to compliment the charm of a family oriented cutesy sweet spot. 

She turned us off so bad, that no one in the party decided to order anything.

I give it 3 stars because I've been before, and thought their stuff  was good, not great. Churn is pretty damn adorable & local, so they get extra love for that. So, for now, until something better comes along it will just have to do.",high

Horrible service. Twice now I've gone there and they keep messing up my drink. I work for Starbucks!! It's not hard to get a drink right! Believe me. Horrible service. The people that work there All have bad attitude. One lady doesn't even look at you when your ordering your drink. I think that someone needs to go In there and fix it and make it a welcoming Starbucks that it's known for. Ya a few of the employees that work there are absolutely wonderful but when you get that one that is just rude it just makes you not want to go there anymore. I stopped going. They still get my drink wrong when my mom goes to get coffee. Horrible.,low
"I ordered a thin crust for carry-out one evening.  The place was somewhat hidden in an industrial area close to Tempe Marketplace.  The staff was very friendly and it seemed like a laid-back, cozy place to eat a meal.

"Hands down the best spa I have visited in the state and perhaps the nation. 

Massages were amazing.

Drinks and brunch were amazing.

Staff went out of their way to take care of our every need.

Went at 11 am to relax for the day and stayed until 5pm which is unheard of for me at a spa once the initial massage has taken place, but this place kept me going all afternoon with the plunge pool, sauna and steam. Also, the pool and spa hot tube outside were amazing. I honestly cannot say enough about AJi and its wonderful staff.

I will return",high
"I don't actually hunt or fish, but after visiting this place, I'd like to take up those activities. This place is like a giant outdoors amusement park.

Plus, now I know where to buy the furniture if I ever get a hunting lodge.",high
"There are other places in town that are less expensive with better sushi choices, and not as loud, but I had an experience today that inspired me to write here this evening. 

I go to Ra (Scottsdale Rd) somewhat frequently for their lunch special which is a good deal: miso soup, yummy salad with addictive ginger dressing, a california roll and four pieces of nigiri. Good stuff. I usually upgrade to a rainbow roll and just pay the difference. 

A few months ago I went to a different sushi place in Tempe. I paid with cash and when my change was returned, the server had ""rounded up"" and treated himself to a presumptuous tip (he didn't return my coins). I called the manager over, went home and wrote a bad review on Yelp, tell people not to go to that restaurant and won't return to eat there again.

This afternoon I sat at the sushi bar, had excellent service, good happy hour eats, and good discussion with the young sushi chef. I paid with cash and my Ra server gave me back my change ... minus coins. I immediately got tense and thought ""great, here we go again."" I called her over to explain. She said that she had rounded-up - in my favor. I counted my bills and saw that she had indeed given me back my change plus a little extra. She said that she didn't have coins, so she just gave me the difference. 

I thought that was very cool. I thanked her, and left a big tip.
Now I'm writing about my good experience at Ra Sushi on Scottsdale Road and will definitely keep going there.

"Finally, a pizza place that delivers to the Grayhawk area. Seriously, when I moved here over the summer and was unpacking I was shocked to learn that no one except Domino's delivers to Grayhawk. At all. Now, on my honeymoon in October I was in Giza, Egypt and saw that, if you stand with the Sphinx facing your back, you can see a Pizza Hut. Yes, that is correct, you can get pizza delivered to the Great Pyramids and Sphinx, but not to Grayhawk. 

But, now we have Zpizza, and it is good. The pizzas range from the usual to more inventive things, such as the Casablanca, which has artichokes. They also feature organic and healthy selections, such as soy or low fat cheese and wheat or gluten free crust. They salads are also fresh and tasty and, while I have not tried them, they also serve sandwiches.

Overall, a good pie, wide selection and it delivers!",high

the service is a little hit or miss but they always keep your coffee cup full-you will almost always have to ask for extra milk-but whatever.

Love having the breakfast sandwich or their pancakes-my favorite ones are no longer on the menu though :( they had apples, sour cream and honey over them SO GOOD!

Not a place for breakfast cocktails though, so don't anticipate a good bloody mary.   their sandwiches are amazing, I've had several and have never been disappointed. 

Despite the shoty service it's a great spot for breakfast or lunch so definitely give it a try.",high

"What's all the fuss?  I'm not sure what folks compare this chain too? The Dead Duck Inn?  Joe's local Chinese Gag house? Are those places that great? Sooo fresh and delicious!? Not in my days? Pre-made sitting around and HEAVY oil is what I see from most other establishments. Even those touted by friends. Maybe it's because they know George from behind the counter.  It's not Pei Wei! Pei Wei is a quick, fresh and inexpensive gift from heaven. Even the hard to please Yelper has to admit, the multiple options you have to modify your meal should give you no excuse not to love what you order. The food is fresh and prepared to order. Even fried rice is made to order. The sauces are made from scratch and are a combination of quality Chinese ingredients. (Chili paste, fresh garlic, scallions, bean curd, and a bounty of fresh Chinese vegetables).  Go Yon China will serve you pre-made sauces with no punch and lots of giggle. The atmosphere at Pei Wei is great! Black and dark red with glossy graphics and all sorts of Chinese! Even with the ""stand in line"" style of dining. Makes me hungry just thinkin' about the joint. However, to me it's a take out Ferrari! Call in, swipe my card and off I go. Sure, it's not Chang's. Still, it's better than the local Dead Duck Inn's ""food"" stained art, with a Chinese New Year paper place mat. 

Of course! I'm looking at the healthier options a Chinese food place may have to offer, and Pei Wei lifts the bar in multiple sets! Get your chicken steamed, go brown rice, add extra vegetables or go vegetarian. Still you may complain...""Oh, is it too salty? Or too sweet?"" Give me a break. This is CHINESE FOOD! And, you won't find MSG. So, if you don't want spicy, salty or sweet; have a meal from Bland of the Rising Sun. But, if you want a highly under rated treat...I ask you to open your mind to this familiar spot for clean, fresh, made to order and ""if you like"" healthy Chinese food!",high
"Bitzee Mama's isn't my mama! My mama wouldn't have kept her hungry son waiting forever for his lunch. She wouldn't have let my go thirsty with no refills. She does make a good bowl of salsa so that makes it alright, right? 

Took my real mama there for lunch.. I ordered the taco salad and ma ordered the cheese enchilada plate.. also a bowl or red chile. Taco salad was alright except the taco shell was so mushy from water it literally fell apart when I picked it up.. glad I wasn't eating the shell. She's old school.. makes a darn good cheese enchilada and refried beans. Struck out again with the red chile.. I swear, can no one except La Canasta make red chile? While the meat was tender and the sauce was smooth it had a weird orange color to it and the meat tasted, well wasn't any beef Ive ever had. 

On the way to the counter to pay my bill I noticed that almost everyone was eating chimichanga's.. well then, looks like I ordered the wrong thing! Place is also uber cheap. 

Be careful what you order and mama will be just fine.",low
"The staff here made the place awesome. They were friendly, on top of things (including when I lost my cell phone), and didn't really blink an eye at the crazy antics of the adult webmasters.

I loved how close they are to food, bars, and even adult romance store on Mill -- I could just walk through the court yard and hit Rula Bula and RA.

However, I had two things I didn't like as much. A) there wasn't enough non-outdoor, non-sunny space to hang out in. Yes, it's Phoenix and people come here to get tan...but I live here, and burn ridiculously easily. Yet everything was in the sun, because there was no large, sun-free area.  Also, b) while the lobby, courtyard and seminar rooms were nice, the hallways and actual hotel rooms seemed a bit outdated. Also, trying to find the pool with no signs? Not so much fun.

All in all, a nice hotel and the perfect place to hold a pervert conference. I'm sure I'll be back at some point!",low
"If you desire true Chicago deep dish pizza, then Nello's should be at the top of your list! This is a staple pizza location in the Valley- and my family has been going for years. Nello's offers a great menu, drink list, and atmosphere. They offer an excellent Mon-Fri lunch special - a large drink, salad and 2-topping personal pizza for $8.99- what a steal!

"As so many others, I found this place because of Guy on triple d. The room mate and I made the drive down one afternoon for some lunch hoping that the experience would make the 30 minute drive worth it. I was kind of surprised when we pulled up. From the outside it wasn't quite what I was expecting. The place is located in a strip mall and nothing really makes it stand out from the road...but figured maybe all the awesome was on the inside. 

We get inside and there are quite a few people. There aren't too many tables and almost all of them were taken. I grabbed the only one available that someone had been recently sitting at and just cleared some of the mess left on the table away. I stepped up to the counter and placed my order for a chicken chimi. It ended up taking a bit longer than I would have expected, but when the food came out it was pretty good. Let me say this now, I'm comparing this place to the Filabertos and Rudolphos and etc. With that in mind, this place is great. The flavor of the chicken is unlike any you would find at those other locations I mentioned. If you compare it to that of items found at other diamonds in the rough, I think it falls short. It is for that reason I give this place 3 stars. If I lived closer to this place I'd eat here on a regular basis I'm sure since the food is not at all bad and the prices are worth it, however I'm not sure why this place ended up getting a spot on triple d.",high

"I have not been to the Outback in years as past visits have, well, sucked. I am not one to complain, I just never go back if I have a bad experience or two. Seriously, there are too many good places to go out to eat to return to business who don't focus on their food. 

So my boss loves this place and she wanted to go and of course as she is the boss I agreed to return to the Outback with her. 

I have to admit this place has changed. Our server, Bree, was excellent! A server can make or break your meal and Bree was on her game. 

The food was really good, OK, I am super picky and was ready to hate it as I have in the past but tonight was different. I ordered the teriaki marinated sirloin. It came perfectly cooked at medium with sweet potato, salad and bread all for $12.95.

"We were at the AT&T store next door and had time to kill. I really didn't want to go to sushi brokers but she insisted that we go for edamame and one sake bomber. Couldn't hurt right?

I am very glad I listened to her. We sat at the bar and placed our order for edamame and bombers... And I might as well throw in some yellowtail because it was good last time.  After the gentleman takes my order another man walks up and introduces himself to me. He stated he was one of the owners and he read my review on yelp and would like to make my prior experience up to me. Boy did he ever.

Service was amazing my entire stay. He brought us one of their signature creations called ""sushi pizza"" which was absolutely delicious. Just enough spice and plenty of fish. He also brought his favorite bottle of sake for us to try which was good as well. At the end of the stay he had taken care of us with the bill to make up for last time as well. 

We received the VIP service the entire time but all the handouts aside..  The fact that Chris not only read my review.. But also took it to heart enough to remember my ugly face and make right by me. To me, this shows the management cares about their customers. I didn't deal with the service I did in the past this time, but you better believe I will willingly be back within his establishment again soon.",high

"I have been eating at Wildfish since it opened and after my most recent Saturday evening dining experience, I must say, the quality of both the food and service have gone way downhill. 

I know....a busy Saturday night and so, perhaps I should give both the servers and chef a break? Sorry. The menu has changed and so has the quality of food - and not in a good way. Let me just give you a brief sample of our experience - the Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer has been changed to a lackluster combination of flavors. The idea of tuna with mango seems lovely however there is a total and complete blandness to the way this dish is now served. The former tuna appetizer was far more tempting. Moving onto the Goat Cheese Medallion Arugula salad. My salad was served sans medallion and literally laden with a huge glob of cold goat cheese and some terribly prepared mushrooms. What happened to the warm, crusted goat cheese? Next, we both ordered the Parmesan Crusted Sole. While the sole was prepared well, I do not recall this dish having a cream based sauce in the past. If memory serves me well, the dish should have had a lemon sauce delicately balancing the flavor of the fish. Cream and sole do not make a happy pair!  I am not sure if this was an error or part of the new menu. Okay, and for the piece de resistance we ordered a side of the Sugar Snap Peas which were actually drowning in a bath of some kind of soy and oil sauce. It actually made me ill to eat it - and my companion, as well. 

Our service was slow and unattentive - although I do realize service can be a very personal experience. 

I was sick with food poisoning all day Sunday - as if the poorly prepared food were not enough to bring down my joy. 

So, I caution those of you who may have once enjoyed this restaurant like me - think twice before dropping a pretty penny at Wildfish.",high

"All the 47-year old men in the joint wearin' sportcoats hangin' out with your beers waiting to catch some hot young tail which won't even happen but you're still lingering around anyway in an awkward looking sausagefest - raise your hands up in the air and say ""What! What!""

To the endless video loop of the Tempe 12 Girls trying to figure out how to best flaunt their mamms for their calendar photo shoots like ohmygawdtheresnowaythatIwillnotbechosenforKipWingerscomebackvideo - raise your hands up in the air and say ""What! What!""

To the dumbfuck DJ who thinks spinning 15 seconds of every song from the 80's and 90's into some megamix is like cool but it's actually more akin to the sonic equivalent of Sybil, raise your hands up in the air and say ""What! What!""

All our servers who were kind of friendly but more like passengers on that UFO named USS Space Cadet that you see on top of the Space Age Lodge restaurant while driving through Casa Grande because you couldn't get ANYTHING right nor understand what we were saying as if we were of a different species altogether, like as if we were human and you were the green hoochie that Captain Kirk got together with in Star Trek - raise your hands up in the air and say ""What! What!"" (if you can)

All those single bathroom stalls where the door doesn't become opaque unless you lock it all the way but I'm sure the ploy here is that as the night goes on and people get more and more drunk, girls will come in and maybe haphazardly lock the door but not all the way but they don't care because they have to pee so hard so they're sitting on the throne and watching people walk by and think that ""Ohmygodit'slikeaonewaymirrorthat'ssocool!"" but then they notice that guys are now just standing there and converging on the other side of the door looking right at them and all of a sudden the drunk girls realize that the door is not a one-way-mirror at all but.... - raise your hands up in the air and say ""What! What!"" 

To my Yelp companions who made all that was Six completely tolerable and proved the point that whatever the case may be with a semi-retarded-but-really-cool-looking Scottsdale venue, if you're in good company, you'll still have a great time - raise your hands up in the air and say ""What! What!""

The only thing I've had that I didn't really care for is the Breakfast Burrito, but that was because it was just a little boring compared to the other choices on their menu.

"I'll preface this review by saying that I've never been a fan of hospitals. My experience with hospitals growing up was always to visit friends or relatives that were sick or recovering from accidents, and I've never felt 100% comfortable at the site of blood, dealing with disease, or ""scary"" situations.  For these reasons, I really respect doctors, nurses, and all of the staff that work at hospitals to help those in need on a daily basis.

All of that being said, I've seen my fair share of emergency rooms in the last few years, and for the most part, I've had decent experiences, even as the patient.  I've actually been to this Scottsdale Healthcare location three times already in the past eight months: twice for scares with the pregnancy and once for a breastfeeding class.  This is the hospital where my OB/GYN delivers, so naturally, this is where I'll be heading when Baby Mess is ready to enter the world... and I'm confident that I'll be in good hands when the time comes!

I've heard great things about the facility itself, especially the labor/delivery area, from other friends that have delivered here.  And from my experience to date, the staff has always been great as well.  Parking can be tricky, but they do offer complimentary parking during the week... and the breastfeeding class I took was very informative.

Bottom line: I don't think any hospital will ever be at the top of my list of ""fun places to hang-out,"" but if you or someone you know is in a situation where medical help / a hospital is needed, you can't go wrong with Scottsdale Healthcare.  Fingers crossed, I'll still feel this same way after I deliver this baby!",high
"This review is for the chain in general. The location we went to is new so it isn't in Yelp yet. Once it is I will put this review there as well. We were there on Friday at 5 PM. 

The reason I gave it 2 stars is because the burger was very good and it was made the way I asked for it. My husbands burger was not.

But, the server and the fries left a lot to be desired. Let me preface by saying that we had been to several other locations. I like my fries crispy. I ask for them well done, extra crispy, scorched, tortured hollow tubes. Whatever their buzz word is for well done. The location will comply. EVERY OTHER 5 GUYS HAS COMPLIED. But not the one at TATUM AND SHEA. She said that corporate said they are not to cook the fries that way. So if we were to put up with soggy fries - yes soggy, then we did not want them. 

She also interrupted us several times which is rude. THEN she went and called corporate just to double check for us and she came to the table and said they said no they were not to cook them that way. Seriously? We did not ask for her to do this. She actually accused us of being undercover shoppers. We started to say something and then again- she interupted.

Listen, if you explain that our choice is not how the company wishes to present their product and we still choose to have them a different way, you should comply. It is after all our money and our decision. I was raised with the rules that #1 the customer is always right. And #2 if the customer is wrong REFER TO RULE NUMBER 1!!

We will not return. They have lost our business and I hope she loses her job.
If you want to try a really good burger AND FRIES place- go to Paradise Valley Burger Company at 40th Street and Bell. You will not be disappointed.",high
"Cadillac Ranch looked really awesome from the outside, this nice red cadillac out front, nice patio outside, and an enclosed bar and grill patio on the side. Upon entering it was pretty dead, well, it was a Monday afternoon after all.

I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak, huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad. I dove into the mashed potatos, which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic, cheese, horshradish, etc), I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt! The gravy was very bland, I ended up putting more salt on it. The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate. They had also put diced garlic in the mix, not roasted, but raw garlic. I love garlic, but I can't eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there, so it was kinda a downer there. The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak, but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy, cook, and serve.

Since I came with friends and family, it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes. My mother ordered the Fish and Chips, they were slightly on the dark side, the fish wasn't fishy but slightly bland, the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol. The fries were really good though! My friend had ordered the same thing, I think she wasn't complaining was because she had ordered mamosa's lol.

Service-wise, it was slow, but don't expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday.

I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie, but that single dish alone won't help this review get to two stars.

All in all, eat at the other different eateries at Tempe Marketplace, I think Cadillac Ranch would be the last resort place if you can't get in to another popular resturaunt at the time.",low
"Love this place!  Went for a stay-cation with the girls for a spa day and stayed the night.  I can't wait to go back!  You are in the city but feels miles away!  The spa is amazing!  Wonderful adults only pool with great refreshing food and drinks.  Then our rooms were clean and comfortable.  Dinner at Kai was nothing short of superb, and breakfast the next morning on the patio over looking the golf course and pool area was also very good.  Overall a wonderful night away.",high
"I am not sure what the deal is with all the two star reviews.

For a casual dinner this place is doing a great job. The atmosphere is fun and friendly, the outdoor patio sparkles with all the little lights and the water feature is very cool to look at. 

My husband had dinner here and found everything much to our liking. The server was friendly and knowledgable. Our drinks were never dry and the food was just was just as described.

It was a little cool the night we ate here but the dozen or so heat lamps did their job well.

The layout of the courtyard is such no matter the size of your group everyone can have a great private meal.",low

"My wife and I almost always head in the direction of Bell Road for lunch or dinner. Today I decided to head west and south. Saw Taps they were new to this shopping center. 
Taps looks like a sports bar when you enter. Only thing there appears to be only 2 TVs or at least where we were sitting I could only see two both above the bar. The decor is appealing, fresh, lots of light coming in from outside. 
We were seated and very soon offered drinks. When the drinks came to the table we had both decided on their special.  Soup and Salad. With this you get a tomato soup, as much as you want and a choice of several salads again as much as you want. 
Not sure why but lately I have had a hard time getting soup that is hot. The soup came out at somewhere well below the state required 130 degrees. We sent it back asking to warm it up. We got it back it was warmer but still not hot. My wife's salad came out with her soup my salad came out a little later. I got the wedge. My soup and salad was very good. My wife also liked her meal. So the food gets a 4.
The service was very slow. It took over 15 min to get the first of our meal to the table. I did order a second different salad as well as did my wife. This also took about 15 min to bring to the table. For what was going to be a quick lunch we were there about an hour. There was only 5 other tables in the place with people at them so the reason for being slow was not that it was crowded. 
The plates bowles they used to serve the food in is extremely small. By the time you had eaten you salad it was all over the table. It is impossible to keep in the small bowel it is served in. If you put the same amount of feed in a larger bowel it would be much better. 

The food was good, the service was not so good. Soup needs to be hot not warm.

Enjoy",high

"After reading all the good reviews, we were looking forward to eating here, but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell. Bummer...the smell just killed it for us right from the get go. Immediately, upon walking in the door, the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks. We did a 180 and walked right out. No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk. 

Get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot, Tasty Thai.",low
"My husband and I ventured up to BLT Steak at Camelback Inn on Friday evening to celebrate our third wedding anniversary, which was two days earlier. We sat inside and our corner table gave us a perfect view of Camelback Mountain at night. 

Our waiter was super nice and did a great job of suggesting items and answering questions when we had them. There was a seperate server who kept our water glasses full all night - we couldn't take more than two sips without having them refilled it seemed like. My only negative about our waiter was that when it was time for a new glass of wine for me, he didn't check with me first to see if I wanted another glass of the same wine. I think we all know the common saying about assuming things...

On to the food...here's what we sampled:

Popovers - delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the butter and sea salt, especially since I don't like butter very much, but it was great! 

Caesar salad - good size and it was one of the best caesar salads I have had in awhile. 

Crabcake - my least favorite part of the meal. While it wasn't horrible, there was a bit too much celery for my taste and not enough crab meat.

Cowboy Ribeye - since it was 22 oz, I graciously told my husband that I would have some of it so he could order it. Now those that know me know that I don't eat red meat because I don't like the taste. But I sucked it up and had some...holy crap, I had a few bites and said, ""Wow, this is really good"". So that should say something about how good it was. However, my husband did think the outside was a tad too well done, although the meat itself was cooked perfectly. While he liked the ribeye, he did think his steak at SW Steakhouse in Las Vegas was better.

Mashed potatoes - is it possible to get divorced over mashed potatoes? I thought we were going to throw it down because one side of the potatoes was just not enough!! They were sooo creamy and delicious. 

Chocolate peanut butter mousse - we got our dessert for free since when I made the reservation I indicated we were celebrating our anniversary. The dessert was a nice way to end the meal, although the chocolate on top was just a touch too rich for my taste.

With tip, our bill came to $162 which we did not think was bad at all for as much as we ordered. Unfortunately we didn't get to sit on the patio or enjoy the view at sunset, but I guess that means we'll have to go back which isn't a bad thing at all!",high
"Johnnie's Garbage dog is the work of the God's. You can't go wrong with any of the dog's here so when you can't make up your mind and everything looks so good - why not just have it all! Seriously try this one.

"Review #800  

I had to wait for a great place to feature for #800.  
Enter: Parent morning movies... in a theater that offers changing tables and dim lights in addition to their ultra nice seating, VIP rooms, 21+ beverages, good food service, incredibly friendly staff, and caramel popcorn.  I'm in!!  Oh, and did I mention it's a beautiful, clean theater, too?

WHO: All mommies, daddies, and other care-givers

WHAT:  Go see a movie with your lil one!

WHEN: Wednesday mornings and occasional featured nights. 

WHERE:  Listings for participating Ultra Star theaters are here... http://www.ultrastarmovies.com/parent_movie_morning.asp

HOW: Because Ultra Star theater is AWESOME.

WHY:  Because you deserve to get out and enjoy a movie... bonus that it's a movie with Early-Bird prices of $5.75!

I wanna give a shout-out to the management, staff and... whoever thought of parent movie mornings to begin with.  It was nice to get out of the house with my lil one, to do something that I used to take for granted when I wasn't a parent. haha  And then to get there and have the theater so nicely set-up, complete with changing tables and dim lights... well that was amazing.  All of the care-givers there were relaxed, happy and able to enjoy a movie without worrying about missing a part if their lil one fussed.  We all had nothing but praises for your kid-friendly attitude and made plans to meet often.  

Thank-you Ultra Star Cinema for a new, great experience.  It's been a while since a place surprised me so much (in a good way)!  

See ya there!",high

"This is hip and trendy eating establishment fills up quickly around lunch time. I did not like the fact that the hostess attempted to seat my companion and I all the way in the back of the restaurant, passing up several unserved tables. Nope, not on my watch. We split the fish sandwich and a chicken sandwich. I really really liked the fish sandwich. The flavors were layered and intense. The chopped kale salad was a nice alternative to a traditional garden salad. The chicken sandwich was a little bland. Our waitress was on top of it, I think her name was Lisa. I was not loving the flies buzzing around while we ate, but what can ya do.",high
"Totally fantastic. 

I love to stop by here whenever I am in Phoenix for their pork sandwich -- which is great. I especially like the barbecue sauce that they use. 

I hear on good authority that many other menu items are good, but I can't tear myself away from the the pulled pork sandwich. They also do a really tasty potato salad, sweet potato pie, and cobbler.",high
"Wow!  This place is amazing.  So amazing I went there twice in a week.  I will start with my dinner.

The ambiance was great.  The place has a nice warm feeling to it and since it was cold outside it was really nice.  They had a large fireplace inside and after dinner we stayed for the great crowd that showed up and went outside.  It was pretty chilly but I didn't even notice as the fire pit was big enough to warm everyone around it.  They also had ample heat lamps.  

The food was fantastic.  I had the tomato soup with the grilled cheese crouton in it and it warmed me up and prepped me for my main meal.  I had the burger and tender belly bacon.  This was an amazing treat for my taste buds.  The bacon was not like any bacon I have had on a burger.  It was a perfect complement for each other.  I wanted another one when I was done but couldn't possibly eat anymore. 

The drinks were great.  They have an amazing wine selection.  The wines we were drinking were affordable and it looks like they really spent some time picking the right wines to carry.  They have some really nice wines that rival the selection of some of the really nice wine bars in Scottsdale as well.  My friends said that the mixed drinks were really well made and they were very happy with how they turned out.  They have just about everything you could want for mixed drinks.

Service was amazing as well.  They were really attentive and the owner stopped by to talk to our table.  

Lunch

The lunch was just as good as the dinner.  I had a shrimp BLT that rivals anything in AZ.  I was glad to see that had a variety of Dr. Pepper/Mr. Pibb on tap.  It was really relaxing to sit there at lunch and enjoy the crowd.  The service was excellent.

Overall I highly recommend Vintage 95 for lunch or dinner.  It is a great place for a date at night and you can enjoy the great crowd afterwards with great conversation and ambiance to fit.",high

I've tried a number of things, and have come to the conclusion that this is the combination that will satisfy me each time:  

Green Burger with thyme fries and the Cookies n Cream Tsoynami.  

Their Green Burger trumps The Plant Cafe and Roam in SF--the only two places I've been to that somewhat mimic it (at least in color).",high

Some items are still quite pricey, but most of the store is extremely reasonably priced.  

If you need something new very quickly for a date or an interview or a special occasion, you will probably find it here.  The employees are nice, friendly, helpful and the dressing rooms are good as well.  Love it!",high

Ordered several of the small dishes.  All were cooked to perfection. and tasted very good. 

Especially liked the chopped salad  and scallops were especially good. 

Nice setting.  Friendly greeter and server.  

The atmosphere is very casual with a touch of elegance. 

Recommended for sure.",high
"It looked like shrimp and it taste like shrimp but it wasn't shrimp. It looked like chicken and it taste like chicken but it wasn't chicken. It was all tofu and 100% vegan AND it was all amazingly great.  Even Amy's mock pork was surprisingly very pork like and I love pork.  You see, I love meat and it's very seldom that I go a day without meat in any given deal. However, this full ""mock"" meat experience was pretty cool and enlightening.  Not only was the lil establishment very clean but the owner was super cool and informative.  Although I don't see myself converting to full veganism anytime soon, I'll definitely be back to try a few more vegan-mock meat dishes. 
Boba Juice is also my new go to place for a much needed icy cold smoothie with boba of course. I've tried a few variations and my favorite is the taro/coconut smoothie, add boba.  I swung by Boba three days in a row for a smoothie and that's a pretty solid indicator that I like the place.  Yay, I am a fan!",high

"I found this place on Yelp, and went there for the lunch buffet. Having read the reviews, I had really high expectations of the place, but was sorely disappointed. Watery sambar and rasam, hard idlis, dosas with a miserly amount of potato stuffing, gulab jamuns that tasted nothing like gulab jamuns, inattentive and too few waiters, and disgustingly dirty bathrooms---in my opinion, Udupi Cafe missed the mark completely. Their a la carte menu items might be better, but I am not going back to find out!",high
"I come here about 4 or 5 times a year. It's consistently good. There is ample seating, so I've never waited long. It's off Central, so the parking is horrid. Their lot holds a good number, but it can be tricky to get in and out when crowded - I don't drive my van here.
  I am always pleased with the food. I find the salads ok - I really like their Balsalmic Vinigarette dressing - I'll mop the leftover with bread.
 I typically get spaghetti with meat sauce and sausage. The sauce has a good flavor.
 The Brown Butter with Mizithra Cheese is incredible - but very rich.
  The staff is always courteous, and I rarely have to wait for anything.",high

Came back this week to test it out and it is the BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever eaten. May have to add this to my rotation of dining spots. 
My other dining mates had  the Shepards Pie, which was delicious and the grilled fish tacos which were also exceptional. I always have a sense of trepidation when I pore over the such an extensive menu. But 3 out of 3 dishes were a winner. Yet another chain with multiple locations in the valley.",high
"I will tell you exactly why this place is so great.

This place will blow your mind.  Not only is the service good, but the food is amazing.  

Here is the rub, your friends are drunk and they start babbling on about wanting to go to some Mexican food restaurant that inevitably ends in the letters ____berto's.  It does not matter which, they all are basically the same.  You go and get your gut injected with evil and then are forced to deal with that for 10-12 hours. Talk about regret. Don't do it.

As soon as I walked out in a new dress, she had the old one out and the new one ready to go and waiting for me in my room.  I might have rated this store a bit higher, but I didn't seem to have any luck here.  Dresses were either way too big or way too small and I just didn't find any that I liked.  I have heard of many people having success here and the prices are reasonable, just didn't work for me.  The dress shopping continues. . .",high

But now the food. Rich, full flavored, comfort food. I don't think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell, just some of the best food around. 

Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts, awesome. A potato side dish, damn good I tell you. For the main course the skirt steak, which was some of the best red meat I'm had in a very, very long time.

"During my five-day stay in Tempe/Phoenix, I honestly did not have a single bad meal.  Every restaurant and coffee joint I stopped at gave me great experiences.  I wanted to end my trip out to Arizona with a good dinner, and I found myself at Dos Gringos to hopefully find that last meal out west.

Honestly, the name sold me pretty quickly.  Obviously, I'm not going to expect fine cuisine and classy dining at a place called Dos Gringos, but being a fan of dives and being one with my fellow man, it sounded like a good place to experience.

Despite it being chilly at night now this time of year, it was still an experience upon arrival.  It's like the tacky, somewhat tasteless, lampooned Mexican version of TGI Fridays, with a whole bunch of crap all over the walls, and a whole lot of hand-painted placards with sayings that make all of our inner-14-year-olds chuckle and appreciate.  The parking was free and plentiful, and I'm always a fan of the grungy, Christmas lights hanging all over the place kind of decor; my kind of style for relaxation and no-nonsense.

There were TVs everywhere, which was nice to watch some Sunday Night Football in the process, and I sat wherever I pleased.  Service was from a cute petite blond waitress who was quick to take my order, deliver my beer, and bring my food when it was ready.  I ordered an enchilada, and two ""street"" tacos, which were corn tortilla apparently.  Don't take my word for it, being an uneducated in Mexican food, east coaster, but I thought it was great.  Definitely different than the kind of ""Mexican"" food I can get in Atlanta.

Overall, I can't say that I had a bad experience.  The food was filling, not really expensive, and tasty to my tastebuds.  Beer, football on a mild evening in a place full of 56 pieces of tacky Mexican flair and a waitress with a great smile, and I can't complain.  Solid, adequate way to end my dining binging throughout the Phoenix/Tempe area.",high
"Long ago, Salvation Army used to be the place to go when you thought of ""thrift stores"". Sadly, this place is WAY overpriced for being a thrift store. I have chatted with other random people who thought the same thing about this one - way too expensive!  :(

As you may tell from recent reviews, I have been on a Pizza crusade. Well, I took a friend to Mellow Mushroom today and the pizza rocked.

"Alas...I've given up the idea of writing a review for a place if it isn't at least 4 stars. Sue me; I'm in the industry. 

Fuego Bistro is by far one of the best places I've been to recently. I was introduced to it this last weekend on a date. Ironically, it's super close to my house yet I've never heard of it. When we were arriving, I was a little curious to see where the hell he was taking me since there aren't any signs really and it's pretty hidden. Once we were inside, though, it was like finding a little treasure.

The patio is welcoming & even though we didn't have a reservation (aka we couldn't sit outside) we snagged a table close enough to enjoy the beautiful weather. 

We started off with a round of mojitos and even though it's been a few years since they've won best mojito...I can say the Prickly Pear was the best I've had in a while. The Ahi Tostadas followed & they were awesome...the sauce added a kick to it & it was a perfect start to the meal.

After, we shared the Fuego Pasta with chorizo, chicken, mushrooms, peppers, & a chipotle cream sauce...huge! What I did eat of it was delicious. My favorite (and my date's I'm fairly certain) was the special...an herb crusted Mahi Mahi with a pineapple sauce, home-made cornbread, & chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. Amazing. Even though the Mahi Mahi might be hard to come by if you visit, the two sides aren't & are so good, I'm droolin' just thinking about it. :)

Dessert? Try the banana burrito. Heaven on the tongue!

Kevin was an excellent server which just highlights the night. It's hard to have a great meal without great service but he provided just that.

If you're in the area...check it out. If you aren't...check it out. I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed.",high
"Very nice views of Phoenix. 

Not a very challenging hike but very enjoyable. Gets steep at the very top but a couple of hard steps will get you to a nice view",high
"Good service. Excellent value. I went for the ""All You Can Eat"" deal they have from 2-9 PM and was there for a few hours. I'm not fat or anything, I just felt like finding a good place to study and eat for a bit. The server was pretty attentive and the kitchen staff was pretty fast. I was kind of disappointed that the menu for the all you can eat deal was missing many of my favorites from the regular menu, but there were still quite a few good choices.",high
"My sis recommend this place for our weekly dinner. We shared on of the large appetizer platters (hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli and dolmades and two pitas). Very good and perfect for a light dinner. I would have to say the best thing was the fresh lemonade...wow! If you like tart you'll love this. 

I thought overall the service was great. Not only was our waitress extremely attentive but the manager stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our food

I give The Flaming Kabob 3 stars!",high
"This is one of my favorite go-to places in Phoenix, and I feel fortunate to live just a mile away. 

The atmosphere is excellent - low-lighting, wooden floors, modern decor in a vintage-looking house-turned-restaurant. 

The food is even better. I have never ordered anything I didn't love (with the exception of the cheesecake, which isn't made in-house - it was just okay). I crave their tuna salad on a regular basis - it's good both in the tuna salad salad and in the tuna salad sandwich.  The grilled cheese is the bomb, and so is the cashew butter banana sandwich. The mac and cheese is superb, as well. Seriously, everything rocks. I highly recommend ordering the mixed greens as your side if you get a sandwich - the dressing is light and citrusy and smacks of homemade excellence. 

Oh, and it won't empty your wallet, either. The prices are excellent for the quality of food you get!",high
"I'm usually not a big buffet fan, but this place changed my mind!  It's very clean, good service, lots and lots of amazing dishes, AND really good sushi!  Weekend lunch was $14.99, but during the week it's $11.99. Well worth every penny. One more comment, this isn't the kind of buffet where ""shifty people"" go. The kind where you need to Purell your hands and arms when you get back to the table : )",high
"I went here for a business conference.  Granted, I just came back from a REALLY nice place in NYC, but I still expected something amazing since it was called the GRAND RESORT.  I must agree with fellow yelpers that it seemed a bit outdated.  I did not like the rooms.  There was a baby sink and mirror area.  A bazaar bar in the living room that just didn't seem to fit.  The beds were mediocre.  I did enjoy the kid free pool!  I found it very hard to find my way around this damn place!  I got lost several times :)  I did appreciate their concierge service - very helpful.  I needed a sewing kit to fix a button that came off - $7 later, I had one small thing of thread, baby scissors and a needle.  Drinks and food were sky high.  We ended up walking down to a little mexican food restaurant nearby.  I don't think I would go back...",high
"Nearly 3 years after a Waikiki vacation, my longing for a Puka dog has been satisfied. Maui Dog is not exactly the same, nor should it be, but it has the same awesome concept, plus more! I've been here twice, once had a beef dog, the other a turkey dog. Both with mild garlic mayo & pineapple. These suckers are huge! And messy! And delicious! The dog has good flavor, mixed with the slightly sweet bun, spicy mayo and sweet pineapple...perfect! I think it would have been a better eating experience if my order was not to-go. The mess these things make all wrapped up is not pretty, but that absolutely does not deter from the taste. I can't wait till I have the time to eat-in and try the rest of their tasty-sounding menu!",high
"I really wanted to like this place. I'm Greek and my family cooks a lot of Greek food.  Their tzatziki sauce was runny and not flavorful. Everything was just real commercialized, nothing tasted right or even close to homemade.",high
"I love this place. I'm mostly here at dinner time to pick up my favorite roasted turkey artichoke panini and sometimes salad and soup as well! The staff is super friendly and recognize when my boyfriend and I show up, maybe because he can never leave without getting a dozen of their amazing cookies! The manager Kaylee is fabulous, she makes us feel right at home and is never unsatisfactory. They may have a smaller parking lot but I guess I have always had good luck with finding a spot! I know I will continue to come back for more.",high
"I really Love this place!
I stopped in for lunch and tried a couple new things. 

The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is:
roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter,
sage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , it's available in two sizes I got the small one.
The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch.

I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect!

My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you can't beat that!",high
"Coffee talk is a nice surprise nestled in the hum drum downtown of Mesa. I have been enjoying their coffee and live talent since I was fifteen. When I was in High School it was a ritual to hit the local dollar movie and then end the night with some coffee at coffee talk. I think the best part was hitting on boys and trying to pass as being at least eighteen years old. My reasons for going to Coffee Talk have changed over the past decade, but the atmosphere and quality drinks and pastries have not changed. There is nothing better than sitting on their back patio and enjoying the cool breeze of the fall. There is something about that place that brings me a sense of relaxation. If you enjoy artistic ambiance, coffee, and live performance's then I would recommend Coffee Talk.",high
"My husband and I both rate this a 3. Food was good, but not great. Fresh veggies and nice flavors. Dont know if bread is made in house. The bread on my sandwich was falling apart, which made it difficult to enjoy.  I think the owner or manager was there, and I expected him to be introducing himself or welcoming us in some way,  but he seemed to be hard at work. I think as a new business, it would be a good idea to be more welcoming to people who are willing to try something new. Also,  there was a girl working there with a really dirty apron and she cussed while we were ordering. Very unprofessional and unsanitary, especially if the owner was there. Also,  wish they had a soup without a cream based broth. Maybe we'd try again for b reakfast?",high
"i was very disappointed in this place. i had driven far out to get here. i live in gilbert. i got the pinkbet, beef mechado and pork adobo. their portions are very measly. they are overpriced and their food wasnt very good or authentic tasting at all. the only thing i liked was the pork adobo.",high
"The shopping center this Rack is located in is absolute poison to my pocketbook. TJ Maxx, Ross and Nordstrom Rack all in a tidy row? Rock on! 

There are great deals to be found here with patient and selective hunting like any other discount retailer, and that these great deals are on brands which Nordstrom's carries makes any awesome deal so very much sweeter. 

Don't go expecting to strike gold at every visit, or expecting Ross prices on Guess shoes, and you will fall in love with the store.",high
"I always find it reassuring when I pull up to a Mexican restaurant that there's a bunch of landscaping trucks parked and the guys are inside eating lunch :)  I thought Mixteca did a pretty good job with my carne asada tacos, rice and beans were not a complete afterthought, decent chips and salsa bar.  The staff was friendly (they actually SMILED).
I was about to get a little p.o.'d when my taco platter and small Diet Coke was more than nine dollars but rest assured the portions are by no means skimpy.  The decor was typical fresh-Mex beach type, I could certainly see myself enjoying a cerveza on the large patio when the sub-100 degree days resume!",low
"We were excited to check out this new restaurant! We were left extremely underwhelmed. We sat in the bar to watch MNF. It would have been nice to be able to hear the game over the discordant pop rock music at a mexican establishment but I understand that you are not a ""sports bar"". It was Monday night and with the exception of a large group  of blue hairs celebrating secretary's day the place was empty.  The bar area managed to fill up, because the Cardinals were on tv and it seemed as thought the high tops and patio were busy as well. 

Our bartender Amanda was very polite and eager to up sell us their flavored tequilas and specialty cocktails. You can tell she was a little wet behind the ears but she was doing her best nothing a little training and experience can't fix. The wait time to receive a cocktail was excruciatingly long though being a former bartender I understand the complexity that new bars go though to develop new and unique cocktails.  We ordered the pumpkin margarita. I applaud the attempt but personally it tasted like puréed baby food. 

I was feeling very open minded and wanted to experience as much as I could that TQLA had to offer so we ordered the salsa trio and chicken tortilla soup.  

Queso dip: cold
Habanero dip: sweet with a swift kick afterwards: not bad
Guacamole: good: but was gone after 2 bites. I guess they feel if they place the guacamole on a bed of green shredded lettuce it will look like there is more than delivered. Fail

Chicken tortilla soup: Thick tomato soup with dry dark meat chicken chunks. Maybe it is just me but I prefer a more broth based ck tort soup and juicy white/dark meat chicken. Bleh: Amanda offered to remove it off our bill but I insisted on finishing mine because I was hungry. My GF pushed hers to the side; DNF. 

Meanwhile; whilst experience our starters we managed without any silverware or napkins and at this point Amanda being the only bartender on managed to become flooded with specialty cocktails in the well; thus not being able to properly oversee her patrons at the bar. Needles to say our drinks were empty, our plates, monkey dishes, empty bowl of chips, 2 cups of bland tortilla soup, saucers and wrinkled up black beverage napkins (used in the place of the real ones) were all tattering on the edge of the bar eagerly anticipating a bus boy to remove them. 

Onto the Entrees:

I ordered the carne Asada steak.  My girlfriend tried the habanero chicken platter. They were delivered by TQLA manager ""Joe"". Whom decidedly pulled himself from enjoying the football game to expedite some food. He crept up behind us and shuffled the entree platters in front of our faces after we spread our dirty dishes closer to the edge of the bar and politely stacked them for our ficticious busboy/girl to remove them properly. Now in my history with management; a decent manager would offer to remove the collection of dishes but instead he decided to ask us if we needed anything else since the look on our faces was disgust. Instead we opted to inform Joe that we would enjoy our meal a little better with silverware and napkins.  He acknowledged that was a novel concept and proceeded to fetch us a pair. Joe wasn't six steps away before he was interrupted by a member of the waitstaff who informed him that what she needed was more important than delivering two setups to some first time customers so they could enjoy their ever increasingly cold food.  At this point my girlfriends temper got the best of her and she jumped up and retrieved her own silverware off of a table in front of Joe and eager waitress to salvage any heat that might have been left in our entrees. 

We dig in:  

Carne Asada: was tender but lacking the Wow factor. 

Habanero Chicken: Tasted like a chicken breast smothered in their warm fire roasted salsa... What happened to the habaneros?  Where is the heat...? Bland

I hope they get better: but until then Nandos all the way. Never saw Joe touch any tables, never offered to help out a bartender who was swimming laps in an Olympic size pool. Occasionally the wait staff would come behind the bar and help out.  This is about the time that our appetizers, chips, soups, and entrees were all removed from the bartop. FYI Joe, the hostess stand can hold itself up on its own. You don't have to stand there and hold it up. Keep an eye on your staff and customers and offer help where they need it so people will be happy to come back and give you a second shot.",low
Great to see a Total Wine closer to where I live.  Large selection and decent prices. Used the $10 off coupon from the newspaper to buy a nice Napa Cab this afternoon.,high
"The food is fairly good.  That's why it's such a shame that the service sucks!  Every time I have gone there, they take forever to bring you water, take your order, bring out food, everything - even when you are the only people in the entire place.  They are always unfriendly.  Out order has been incorrect on a couple occasions.  I really wish they had better service.  I just won't go there anymore because of that.",high
I second Sarah's review. Try the 49er flapjacks and Ron's Special Southwest Eggs (they come with nearly diaphanous potato pancakes). Don't forget to hit the ATM -- there's a Wells Fargo at 68th and Camelback.,high
"I have been coming to this place for atleast 5 years. This is a favorite of my friend's whole family. 

This place is so very consistent. They always have the same good things. If you're looking for buffet variety this is not the place. 

Everyone is so very nice. This place has been open for 30 years for good reason. I have never ordered from their menu because their buffet is so good. 

Go and try not to get hooked. 

Enjoy!",high
"I do not understand less than four stars. We had six different plates. Beet Salad, Rabit, Butter,Scallops,Strawberry desert, and Peach desert.  All were brilliant. Our favorite (both agreed) was the Beet Salad. It was so fresh and had a perfect combo of flavors and textures. 

Service was way more than perfect. One note they are now BYOB with a corkage fee for Beer and Wine. No fee if the Beer or Wine is from Arizona.

One note for FnB we were preplexed with the lack of pork on the menu :-)",high
"If they werent located around the corner, I would never use this store.  I have taken back produce MULTIPLE times due to expiration so watch the dates when buying!!",high
"So i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place, I would support the first amendment with my wallet. Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least. We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside. We were literally outnumbered by the people working there. I say this because somehow, despite this fact, the service was HORRENDOUS. I mean we got our order out fine, but our waitress dissappeared after that. At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself. The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was. The Philadelphia roll was decent, but the California roll was really bad. When it came to paying, I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile. Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table, the waitress didn't return. If it wasn't for the cash I had on me I'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!",low
"Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, don't even bother going. You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.

It's simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received. 

I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time. Wrong thing to do. I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant. 

It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should. 

Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.

We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point. 

To be honest, I can't even remember what the food tasted like, which isn't quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.

Maybe it wasn't even the Groupon. Who knows. All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it.",low
"My fiance and I tried the place because of a Groupon.  We live in the same neighborhood and see the place all the time but the look of the place was never enough to draw us in.  There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  It's in a strip mall and looks old.  At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung.

When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat, drink and socialize at.  To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.  It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the ""look how good I was"" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look.

We were greeted by friendly gentleman who seated us on the main lower floor.  He handed us our menus and asked if he could get us something to drink.  There is no drink menu on the menu.  No beer list, no soda list, no liquid period.  We asked to see the wine list, which had only bottle prices and doesn't even hint that they sell wine by the glass.  Once I asked if they had beer and sold wine by the glass it was like we made a breakthrough.   The menu seems a bit outdated so I  went with the Lasagna, the basics.  While we sat waiting for our meal, the salads came.  Weird...the menu didn't mention anything about a salad nor did the waiter.   More lack of information from the menu.

Now on to the decor.  It is terribly outdated.  Tacky, bland, pale paint scheme, brass fixtures, mirrors and cliche wine bottles.  There were beautiful fresh flowers throughout which we really enjoyed.  I was unfortunately seated directly in front of two paintings both with a woman and a little girl drinking what appears to be wine.  I'm guessing they are personal family paintings but they are horribly out of place and bordering on creepy.  I couldn't take my eyes off of them and that distracted me throughout the night.  This place needs a makeover, new modern paint scheme and some updating on the artwork.

The lasagna came.  It was OK at best.  I tried my fiance's chicken genevese at it was horrible.  The chicken tasted like it was boiled which is an instant dish killer for me.  We did not take our leftovers.  We asked for the check and it came with a after dinner cordial which was a nice surprise and tasted delicious. 

We won't be back.  To be honest Oregano's lasagna is better by far.",low
"Excellent family owned business that knows how to make real Italian dishes!  Their prices are a little on the high side but you get plenty and it's good.  We had enough left over for next day's lunch. 

The waiter was nice and attentive even though it started to get packed at around 7ish. They even gave us free Amaretto drinks after dinner! :)  Going back for another romantic dinner soon.",low
"Culver's is a must if you have not had the chance to try them out. I believe they have several stores now here in the valley.

"Not a bad sub which I find to be something I can eat almost daily.  Prices are a little higher than a Subway but their meat is freshly sliced to order and they do a much better job with their bread.  They are still lacking the hard crust french/Italian bread that I crave since leaving the East Coast but this is something I have learned not to expect out here in AZ.  

The girls that work behind the counter are excellent and a few have been there for years.  They know service and are fast and great at keeping the lines at bay.",high
"What ever you do don't waste your money here.  I am not the person who likes to send food back, in fact I hate to do it.  I had no choice here, this was by far the worst mexican food I have eaten.  The food has such a horrible after taste.  I not only hated my meal but tried my boyfriends as well and it was still terrible.  The service compares to the food, we waited forvever just for a server to come over and greet us.  I wouldn't even recommend this place to my enemies.",low
"OK: call me 'weird' here: but; I liked the funky (very) Old School ambiance of MacAlpines when my fiance and I went there this past Sunday for the Studebaker and friends car show.

Admittedly; I was there once before ca. 1999 and was NOT impressed but things have def improved IMHO.

I had a Club sandwich and it was one of the best ones I've ever had, at least in recent years. Would eat one again. The chocolate milk shake was OK but could have used a tad more syrup but, I'd have one again.",high

"I've been a CVS guy for about 15 years, spanning three cities across the country. Some branches are better than others, some regions are better than others - they're no better or worse than other national chains which also have some good branches and some bad branches. I picked them because they have a great ""rewards program"" and because they have heavy presences in places where I travel often.

So this is a bad branch. There's a couple decent check-out kids, but in general their employees are among the worst trained I've ever seen, in terms of providing polite, timely, friendly customer service. They avoid your eyes when they see you looking for something in an aisle, lest you bother them with a question. They never EVER greet you with a smile and a ""good morning"" or a ""did you find everything you need?"" while you check out. They have inconsistent policies about whether or not coupons can be scanned from iPhone or paper copies needed (the manager basically called me a liar when I said checkout people have scanned my iPhone coupons many times in the past).

I guess if you sell very profitable liquor and meds, you make money no matter how bad your attitude is. It's not like Walgreens and Rite Aid are setting the world on fire with their customer service either....

If you don't travel a lot like I do, pick a nice local independent pharmacist...",high
"Joe's has long been one of our favorite restaurants in Gilbert.  The pulled pork is excellent, the sides are even better, and the service is always friendly.

Don't be intimidated by a long line, even out the door, as it moves fast.  The cheesy potatoes and corn are great.  The lemon cake is very moist and a nice finish to a meal.

Be sure to stop by on your birthday and pick up a free meal.

Since when live in the extreme heat it is a bit nice that it is outdoors.              There is a major selection or stores ,restaurants and services here.  My girlfriend likes it as well.

They did a beautiful job with the remodel (I'm a mid-century and Haver fan.)  The food wasn't anything to write home about.  I have to admit that I'm particularly tough on restaurants filled with...I don't know what to call them...scenesters, I guess.  Service was ok.  Its not BAD, mind you, its just that I don't get it.

"I joined a friend for a two hour evening ride at CCO. We were the only two riders, may be because it was a Sunday eve and all the tourists were drinking their mimosas by their hotel pools.
The horses looked very well taken care of. Mine was 17 year old Sundance, a beautiful brown male. I've never ridden before, and he was easy to control. Our guide Ed was patient, funny and awesome company. He showed me the basics and was always there with a word of encouragement and a tip or two.
Tip for the guys, if you plan to trot, wear tight jeans, you will be thankful at the end of the day. The city slicker that I am,
I left my phone in my shirt pocket, ended up dropping it while on the ride and Ed helped us go look for it. The desert, sun set over the mountains and the sandstorm about 30 miles away all made this a very memorable evening.
I highly recommend CCO.",high
"I have gone here several times and have tried the pizza, subs and the calzones.  I have not had anything there that I did not like and the only reason I don't give this five stars is because everytime I am in there it seems a large group with lots of young kids has just sat down (or come to run around me while I try to eat) at the same time as my date and I.  I admit, I wish restaurants had sections for families so that those who do not like watching kids run around or spitting food out of their mouths on to the table could eat in peace, but that is just me and that is why I have dogs and not children.

Anyway, this place has awesome food, good service and if you can handle large groups of families then I highly recommend you take the drive out here to give it a try.",high

"I just had a pretty unfortunate experience at Bison Witches in Tempe.  I remember liking this place when I went to ASU but not anymore!  It literally (no exaggeration) took 1.5 hours for our lunch, which was 3 people eating soups and sandwiches.  Our order took 45 minutes to arrive at our table (again, soup and sandwiches!), and several tables around us that had come in AFTER us, got food before us.  I normally am pretty easy going about stuff like this, but the server and a guy that appeared to be a manager/owner didn't even acknowledge the long wait time, no apology, nothing.  They weren't even that busy!  Our server barely even spoke to us when she came to the table, and acted like we were inconveniencing her.  I also saw her roll her eyes at another one of her tables as they got up to leave.  What kind of service is that!?  I wish I could say the food was any saving grace, but it wasn't.  Mediocre soup in a bread bowl, less than mediocre turkey on a bland sandwich.  I will NOT be going back, there's no point!  Save your time and money and hit up another one of the tasty places on Mill Ave.  Trust me, you'll be better off!",low
"I've been coming here for a little over a year and I can't say that I've ever been really all that impressed.  

Yes, they ""hand wash"" your car but I feel like that's the only pro on the actual cleaning of my car.  I've never really been happy with the vacuuming, not sure that they really do anything other than the mats.  When I get in my car all the old fuzz and hair is still on the seats.  The last 2 times I've been there they've missed cleaning parts of my car and I have to say something.  The last time they cleaned 3 out of 4 of my tires, even a stranger commented to me about how he found it odd they missed it.  Also, asked for air freshener and when I got in my car it still smelled like ummm, well it didn't smell fresh and clean.  I just left there and again I had to ask them clean the inside door.  It was covered in dirt and dead grass, how do you miss that?!? When I called someone over to clean it he then noticed that the wind shield was still dirty.  I mean, really?? And again, no air freshener even though I asked for it.

I gave 3 stars instead of 2 because I do appreciate the fact that this is not a chain.  I'd rather give my money to a family owned spot instead of some corporate junk.   The tall, blonde woman who greats you is always very nice and helpful.  I like that I'm not hounded about getting my windshield or cracks fixed a million times and sometimes they offer deals on LivingSocial which is great. 

Overall I feel like this is a good place to come and just have the surface of your car washed unless you want to pay big bucks to actually see a difference in the inside of your car.  Make sure you check your car before leaving to ensure they have actually cleaned everything.",high
"Just had a couple beers and some appetizers since it was late.

The rock bottom ipa is a fairly decent ipa compared to the numerous I have tasted. Just had the one beer though so can't speak to the rest of there drafts.

The chicken quesadilla and the ahi appetizers were very good. The ahi was a sushi type appetizer with a soy based sauce, garnish, and chop sticks. The quesadilla was good and I had no complaints about it. Service was good for a Sunday night and they are open late. Kitchen closes about 11 though. 

I will be coming back.",high
"First time there the other night.  Friday night, not very crowded for 7:30pm.  We were shown to a table in what looked like a back room - the table was not set, there was just a tablecloth and that was it.  The room is to the right as you walk in.  There were only 2 other tables in there and the windows were covered (no view) - it was weird so I immediately asked to be seated in the main part of the restaurant.  Decor seemed 'cheap' - just my initial impression.  Food was pretty good.  Pancetta wrapped shrimp app was good; Service was good.  Entrees were pretty good - Chicken Parm, Fettucine Bolognese all tasty, but not sure I would go back.  Caesar salad was a bit disappointing...asked for anchovies on the side - never delivered.",high
"Yum, yum, yum. 

I have put this in my regular rotation for every time I'm in Gilbert.  They have great sandwiches, sides, and burgers and for the most part we have had some fantastic service (my friend has had one or two iffy experiences but mine have all been great)... this past weekend I had one of their burgers of the week which had some white wine grilled onions with Gruyere cheese and it was KILLER, probably my fave burger I've had there.  I've also tried their soups which have been great and their grilled cheese.  The Caprese Pasta Salad is so refreshing and a fave side of mine!",high
"Looking for something refreshing to escape this crazy AZ heat? Rita's may be your answer!

Lemonade, Cherry, Mango? Check, Check, Check!  I ended up taking home a quart of half lemonade and half cherry.  My husband and I dug into it last night.

Next time I'll have to try the custard... or perhaps the Sour Patch Kid flavor that is coming out this week!  Mmmm!",high

"I've been to happy hour here on a few occasions now and I have to say that I'm becoming more and more fond of Geisha. The prices are pretty decent, but what really makes this a great happy hour place is the ambience - it's lively and fun!

Happy hour is 4p - 7p every day and is half off sake bombs, appetizers, house sushi rolls...and I just realized specialty drinks as well! I need to go back so I can try the Hello Kitty and Harajuku Lover specialty drinks! Both look delicious. 

Not the most amazing sushi and appetizers, but definitely not bad considering the price. And for me during happy hour anyway, it's really more about the company and drinks than the food.

Happy Happy Hour Hopping!",high
"If you're looking for a lunch salad/Sandwich, this place is great.  Not too busy, but that's good because it's very quaint.  The roost beef and bluecheese sandwich will fill your stomach and the cookie side is a nice treat.",high
"I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and that's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesn't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal!


They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they weren't ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they don't look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it. 


So far I've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasn't as creamy than I'm used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on. 


I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool). 


Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that I'm not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. It's just so good! A definitely must have for next time.

That's about as much my tummy let me eat for today. I'm sure the rest will be just as good and I can't wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies.",high
"I went here with my husband last Sunday afternoon.  We had a 2 for 1 coupon out of the Entertainment guide.  We are from San Diego and have been trying to find Mexican food places similar to the food out in San Diego.  We pulled up to the location and were debating if we should go in or not.  The area wasn't the best, and it was in a tiny strip mall.  Kind of looked like a taco shop.  We decide to go in, because we were starving.  Inside it looked completely different.  It was a little dark and dated.  But the atmosphere was very causal and the hosts were super nice.  We sat down and right away got some nice warm chips, salsa and beans served to us.  I was feeling like a margarita and was going to get the house one, when the waitress said they had 99 cent margaritas available.  We ordered our food and didn't have to wait very long to get it.  Super good food and really cheap 99 cent margaritas. The margaritas were served in pretty nice size glasses but a bit strong.  FYI, I think you're getting really cheap alcohol in there, seemed pretty stiff. I started buzzing after my second glass.   My husband even loved the Chile reino that he tried from my plate.  He usually doesn't like it at all.  The carne asada was seasoned very well, it was a great change from some of the bland Mexican food I've had out here in phoenix. My husband had the beef chimichanga and it was seasoned really well also.  For the price you can't beat it.  From the outside the restaurant seems a little ghetto looking, but once you get inside it's pretty nice in there.  I would defiantly try it again.",high
Poor service-small portions-pricey,low
"I prefer going to this location of Macayo's over the others because of the ambience. It's way different than the others and it doesn't ""feel"" like the other Macayo's. This one is much more festive. It has a ton of patio seating and lots of shade. The antique train outside makes it much more interesting. The parking lot, however, is right next to the light rail tracks and it's small, so parking is a little dicey. They sacrificed parking for patio seating. The prices are extremely affordable. Their food is very good. Service is always consistent. Cheap margaritas. I've never been here on a weekend. I always stop in on a weekday around noon and then it has some business people on lunch.",high
Each time I eat here...I always look at the menu and end up having the same thing - the ceasar salad with salmon. Nothing else really interests me on the menu. The service is good - no complaints there. But its nothing special. But I will tel you this - there is nothing like a cold beer on a hot day!,high
"So, this will not be my best review, especially when I expected so much more from this place.

Lets get this out of the way and on the table first, this ws not a bad place to go, but, it wasnt my favorite by any means.  I went in expecting to pay a lot for the meal, and rightfully expected the best food I have ever had, and that was just NOT the case.  From the high prices to the limited menu, I would expect this place to specialize in the particular menu items, and would hope to have my taste buds dancing while I shout for more.  I didnt.

We started the meal with burratta forno cotto mozzarella.  it consists of oven baked burrata mozzarella served with grilled ciabatta, fried eggplant, lemon-truffle vinaigrette and parsley.  There were only two tiny ciabatta slices which was not the first complaint.  the second complaint would be that the fried eggplant could have used a bit more flavor.  (perhaps a little lemon pepper in the batter would have done some good) Lastly, the dish could have satisfied by just having a bit more cheese.  This dish was not bad by any means, just expected a bit more with the $12 price of two miniature slices of ciabatta and two thinly sliced pieces of eggplant.

on to the salad.  I dont know about you, but, when I order a salad, I expect a salad.  this was a salad, just not with any lettuce or salad look.  we ordered the caprese di pomodoro.  this dish is made with heirloom tomatoes, preserved lemon, herbs, fresh burrata mozzarella and extra virgin olive oil.  from the description, i assumed, dont ever assume, that this was going to have some spring mix as a salad base, then have the tomatoes witih cheese and basil, and then the lemon with olive oil as a dressing.  WRONG.  it was nothing more than what the description said.  it was two tomatoes cut in half, with a small amount of cheese and a few basil leaves and then the lemon preserve mixed with the olive oil on top.  dont get me wrong, this ws absolutely AMAZING, and I would love to have it again.  It is just not what I expected, so, it would have been nice to know what exactly I was ordering for $10.

To make matters worse, our so called salad took about 30 minutes to make its way to the table after putting in the order.  it took so long that the chef actually apologized and told management that he was going to send out a soup for us for the wait.  we were fine and in no rush, but, when we were already having our food take forever and told we were going to get soup, we expected it.  the soup never came.

finally, after waiting for and hour and a half for our main entree, we got our food.  it was good, but, nothing to write home about.  my pollo portofino was bland to say the least, and was actually a little dry.  the potatoes were decent, but again, a bit bland.

my date got the ravioli di mozzarella con salsa all'arrabbiata.  the ravioli pasta was so thick that you really couldnt taste the filling, and the sauce was to sweet in my and my date's opinion.

we however did order a side of the risotto parmigiano, and this was just amazing.  I am very happy that the recipe was on a poast card that came with the bill.  I will be making this at home in the coming week.

for dessert, we ordered pistachio gelato.  it was the best gelato I have ever had.

when it comes to a decision of returning to Alto, it will not be high on my list due to being over priced for what you get and all around, just not the best first experience.  I will however think of stopping in to get some risotto or gelato to go.

when it comes to good Italian, I think I will be sticking with Italian Gratto or Pane e Vino.",high
"This is the new mecca of Phoenix music. 

Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nita's Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all! He is a music fan first and ... well ... that's just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman. 

The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt). The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come!

"Went here for brunch this morning (Sunday) and there were a few things that diminished the experience for me:
* You claim New Mexican grub and then you charge for chips and salsa or sopapillas which are standard complements to any New Mexican restaurant meal.
* At $3, the coffee is  a rip off! Seriously? We're not talking cappuccino, people and you're selling build-your-own Bloody Marys for the same price!
* The carne adovada was tender but not very spicy.

That said:
* The green salsa was really good.
* I'm so desperate for carne adovada, I'll settle. (besides, $9 is more than a fair price for 3 eggs, black beans and carne adovada in a bowl on a flour tortilla - even if it was more beans than pork.)
* There are several options for $5; and, if they are all like the eggs benedict, they are generous portions.
* The patio is nice and the bar area feels like a neighborhood pub (not a cave, but that's not got to be a bad thing!)",high
"I think that most of the negative reviews I've read about this Gold's gym really stem from people's own insecurities. I have been going here almost 2 months now and have never had a single issue with the gym or ANY of its staff or members! I find the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful, and I was even offered a free personal training session when I signed up to help me get on the right track to meeting my fitness goals! 

I read one review about some poor girl stepping onto a treadmill that was going full speed and falling off... who does that?? Did she not see the treadmill going FULL SPEED? Don't blame lack of common sense on the gym or its staff...

Another review complained that there are too many gay men hanging out in the locker room. REALLY? As a straight male, I can say that I've never felt uncomfortable, and have never been solicited for sex in the locker room. Get over yourself and your homophobia dude. Some yelpers truly disgust me....

I'm a widow, and I have a long-term chronic condition, still, they allowed their tenant to pick on me, throw a bottle at me, then their maintenance person told me the lock was never changed, They did not paint, but lied and said they did. It's totally drug-infested, They don't keep their word.  I would skip it.",low
"So I ventured in here today for a quick nosy hoping to see what was on sale. I figured nothing in these economic times could be TOO expensive...They had a lot of their items FULL PRICE much to my disdain, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a large bin on throw pillows for 75% I personally was in need for some and bought some super cute ones for $6.00 each originally $35.00 yeah great deal!!! So I was a happy camper...I even found two that matched that weren't damaged SCORE...

They were setting up for Christmas so it was a little jumbled, but they had some cute Halloween stuff out but it was weird half the stuff was marked down and half wasn't, it was so confusing I just passed. I don't like the guessing game, either mark down the season or don't KWIM?

"According to the reviews I have read for this spot, I must have ordered from them on an off day. Today for delivery, I ordered a cup of soup (something tomato based with potatoes and beef in it), 1/2 Vermonter sandwich, lemonade and a cookie. 

The soup was ok (bland, but ok), the sandwich was...well, kind of sad looking. A big dark green piece of wilted lettuce, barely any of the 'cranberry mayo' or whatever was supposed to be the mayo on there, the turkey and ham tasted great...there just wasn't very much of it, and they completely forgot my request for a side of mayo, mustard and a knife/fork on a triangle cut piece of wheat bread. I wasn't able to choose my chips, so ended up with some plain ones and my cookie was undercooked by about 10 minutes. The outer circle was baked, but the rest was cookie moosh. (Which is fine when you are in a cookie dough mood, but alas...I was not.) The lemonade was FANTASTIC though. I don't believe I'll be trying this one again unless I'm in a pinch, but I'm happy I tried them today instead of just jumping into a catering order with them. This may be the only time I have been mislead by previous Yelps. *sigh*",high
"lululemon is the best clothing store to hit Scottsdale since Ross. 

Even though exercise shorts there cost more than an evening in Tijuana they are worth every penny. So what if the pants there cost $160? They are awesome. Would Batman ever question Alfred about how much he paid for the Batmobile? No. Because the Batmobile is awesome and Batman would have paid any price for it. 

The men's side of the store doesn't carry a wide collection but what I did find was more magical than the sorting hat at Hogwarts. Everything is so comfortable and if you're overweight most of the pants and shorts have elastic so you don't look like a muffin when you put them on. 

I also like the workers there too. They are friendly and helpful and helped me understand that even if I liked some of the women's shirts there it would not be a good idea for me to purchase one and wear it. But I love teal I cried!

"Blue 32 wins my MVP award. I practically lived at this place during the Giants World Series run, and loved every moment of it! 

Despite the fact that I am still stuck in an orange and black-out World Series Championship daze (that will probably continue for at least another month or so), I must up the rating of this place to 5 stars because Blue 32 is now my favorite sports bar in all of Scottsdale. The service is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent for game watching.

Here are the main two reasons why I will keep coming back here: 1. Food - This is the best bar food ever! You must try their onion rings, they are crazy delicious. Also if you aren't in the mood for fried food they have tons of healthy options as well. 2. TVs - Sports fans, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to TVs. Outstanding visibility from every angle of the restaurant. No sports bar in Scottsdale can compete with Blue 32's TVs.

Go here for a game and you won't be disappointed. I decked myself out in orange and black, screamed, jumped around with excitement and just all around enjoyed myself while hanging out in the bar area during the games. Overall, Blue 32 is a high quality sports bar and you've got to check this place out!

"I was so excited to try these cupcakes, but I've got to say I was pretty disappointed, especially after waiting in quite a long line. I am a cupcake fiend, but they were not nearly as good as I thought they would be. I got 7 different flavors and I didn't think they were very sweet and, cake wise, they all kind of tasted the same. The frosting wasn't all that great either. My mother and kids tried them too, and didn't think they were all that great. Don't get me wrong, they weren't awful, but I'd never go back. I tried them and now I'm done. I'd rather save my money (and my time) and bake my own cupcakes.",high

"This place is usually packed late after coming back from Dos Gringos or whatever since it's right around the corner. There's a reason for this, their pizza is good. Big, wide slices... in fact their slices are double what you'd normally get anywhere else. Thin crust, chewey crust, great sauce flavor.  If you do get pizza here, order it by the whole pie. You won't be disappointed. I only will order a meat slice if I know it just came out of the oven. Personal preference and this is for any pizza by the slice joint.

When I was there Monday night, the owner was singing softly. It reminded me of my mom when I was a little kid and how she used to sing to me............ i told him to sing more. I'm kidding, it was a woman singing.....so I'm not knocking this place, just pizza by the slice places in general.",high

"5 BIG STARS

For service and quality of meal, restaurants really don't get any better than this. Multiple servers, dressed in NY black are constantly there for you.

This restaurant prides itself in using local products & blending them into traditional meals, ala Alice Waters, and they do an excellent job.

For starters, we had (are you ready?):
-""Macerated Local Vine Ripened Heirloom Tomatoes, Fossil Creek Goat Cheese & Mascarpone Tart,"" including Buckwheat & Saguaro Seed Tart, Basil foamed from the garden, Black Ice, and Gila River Olive Oil; and
-""Pan Flashed White & Green Asparagus with Chanterelles & Cholla Buds,"" including Chanterelle Mushroom Fondue, Desert Quail Egg (sunny side up), Red Currents and Aged Sherry.

And that was just the beginning! For dinner we had:
-""Veal Ribeye Rubbed with Sandalwood, Dry Mole & Green Chile Sand,"" including Mesquite Cooked Desert Fruit Chutney, Truffle Frites, and Rutabaga Cobbler; and
-""Local Pecan Crusted Colorado Lamb with Native Seeds SEARCH Mole,"" including Pastry Tapenade of Fennel, QC Olives, Eggplant, Wild Mushrooms, Heirloom Tomatoes & Iitoi Onions.

Everything was exquisite!

This meal was to die for!

Any complaints at all? Well, yes, but very minor. This place is actually in a Sheraton, but I guess that insures a good stream of patrons that can afford such meals.

And the decor? Not very good. It needs a serious MAKEOVER.  Wall-hangings, window treatments & carpeting aren't much.

So there you are...",high
"I am definitely quite shocked at some of these reviews. I disagree with the lack of flavor, and the tasteless dishes some reviewers experienced while eating here.

 I recently moved over to the N. Phoenix area, and while craving some Vietnamese food a few months back, I decided to  browse ""Yelp"" to find it. I came across these reviews, and decided to check it out regardless of the poor comments of this establishment. I phoned in my order without looking at a menu,  ( Chicken Pho, Egg Rolls,& Spring Rolls) nor  knowing where they were even located, I eventually found it in the little nook of the Fry's shopping center. I walked in to a very tiny little restaurant  with a cute little man standing at the cash register holding my wonderfully smelling  food in hand.

 When I got home, I realized that he had forgotten to add the Noodles (which obviously is the  biggest part of this dish) I was a little miffed but eventually got over it, once I tried the appetizers we ordered,and the wonderful flavor of our pho. I knew it was such a harmless mistake so I didn't hold it against them. After consuming our wonderful and inexpensive meal I came to the realization that THIS is my new Fav Vietnamese spot in the N Phoenix area.. I've eaten their at least 5 times since I found this place in Jan. That says something in my mind!! 

In my opinion they  beat Pho Bang, and Avina HANDS DOWN!!  It's clean, inexpensive, flavorful, and definitely NOT tasteless.. A definite treat if you ask me. Speaking of which I think I'll order some now :o)",high
"Haus Murphy's is fabulous in so many ways that I can really only hit the highlights here. Even if German food isn't your favorite (I dislike saurkraut and cabbage), the service and food is great.

The service was wonderful. I was almost 2 hours earlier than my friends, so I used a table in the bier garden to do some work on my computer (with my own mobile hotspot. . . Haus Murphy's does not have wi-fi). The entire staff made me feel welcome as a sipped a wonderful German beer and did some work.

My friends showed up, we had great dinners, and then we continued on to Glendale Glitters. If I'm able to make it over to Glendale from my home in Mesa for Glendale Glows in January, I will certainly stop in Haus Murphy's. 

Authentic German or not (I've never been to Germany, my friends of mine who have seemed to really enjoy the food too), this place is worth the visit. 

Enjoy!",high
"I'm a little late to the party....I finally got around to checking out the new and improved Chez Nous last weekend. This is sad because the new location is within walking distance of my humble abode. 

Anyway, the place looks fantastic. I love that it has the same vibe, the same house band,  the same goofy rock sculpture (WTF is that?) and the wallpaper. LOVE the wallpaper.

"In 'n' Out, I don't know how to tell you this, but . . . I've found someone else.  No, no, it's not like that, it was nothing you did!  Your burgers with their fresh toppings are delicious... but sometimes I just need a little change of pace, maybe something with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and bacon... mmm... bacon.  Oh, sorry.  You want to know the name?  I don't see why that...  You insist?  Okay... it's Five Guys.

Oh!  You're upset!  YOU'RE upset!  Well let me tell you what - Five Guys' fries are delicious, whether they come in Cajun OR regular!  And I NEVER liked your fries, In 'n' Out!  I just pretended to like them, but they're skinny, kind of limp, never flavorful, and you don't get very many.  Five Guys cuts 'em thick, salts them up, and pours an extra scoop into the bag, how do you like that!  And they give you FREE peanuts to munch on while you wait.  You never give me anything!

What?  No... you're right, Five Guys is a more expensive taste.  That's true, it is over $10 for a burger, fries, and drink, as opposed to your $5.  And I do have to park in a garage that loosely resembles a labyrinth designed by Escher.  But if you eventually make it up to the restaurant, they VALIDATE.  You have NEVER validated me!  Oh, that's right, you have surface parking, but don't try to pretend that's a feature with the temperature hitting 100!  You're ridiculous.

What's that?  Does Five Guys have milkshakes?  Uh... hm.  Milkshakes.  I never thought about that.  They don't.  Would you mind if I got my burger and fries from there and then came to you for the shake?  No?  Fine.  You're so overprotective and hyper-traditional sometimes.  Live a little.

I believe the owner is a Sooners fan so that game rules over others, even Devils games.  The volume wasn't on for the Devils game, wth.  Waitress was lazy, didn't come by the table often.

"Brought my car here b/c of the reviews I read on yelp. My fan was running excessively. The mechanic came and looked at my car. The coolant was low. He grabbed a can and filled it up. No charge. I then told him I needed new struts. He quoted me a price that was cheaper than the one quoted to me in CO a few months ago. I honestly didn't shop around for a cheaper price here in Phoenix, which is unlike me. The reviews here, and fixing my fan problem at no charge had me sold. It seems so rare to find an honest mechanic now-a-days, especially in this economy.  Made an appt. Car was finished super quick, in the time frame that was promised. The mechanic went out of his way to show me the damage struts he replaced, then told me my new struts came with a lifetime warranty. Dang, did I time warp back into the 50s?  Hopefully I won't have a need to go back, but if I do, I'd gladly drive out of my way one hour round trip for their honesty again.",high
"Went here for lunch today (Wasn't feeling the hot pocket I had in the freezer here at work) 

What can I say. Its Subway. Its consistently mediocre. Its not overly fantastic, but its not knock me on my ass terrible. 

Subway is kinda like Olive Garden for me...some times you just need mediocre food. I don't know why it is...and maybe I am the only weirdo... But one thing is for certain, it always tastes the same every time I go there. Maybe it has that high school nostalgia for me. I dunno. I also like stail Necco waffers, so maybe dont pay attention to any of my reviews. 

I get the Spicy Italian, on cheese bread (duh), provolone cheese, light mayo, mustard, lettuce, cucumbers, olives, onions, peppers and LOTS of banana peppers, S&P. That's how I roll.",high
"I went for family birthday on a Friday night. Only a few people in dining room eating. (1st clue to leave.) Ordered a margarita. It's extra to have it shaken... But I ordered that way. It was mostly sour mix. An it was awful (How do you mess up a margarita?(2nd clue to leave) Server is surprised we wanted to order dinner! (3rd clue to run!) Very disappointing. I got the chicken fajitas, they had sauce all over them. Shrimp appetizer consists of 3 shrimp $8. Salsa was good.  I will never go back. Good luck Salty. I love your decor.

"I ate here over the weekend while attending Comicon.  I was actually pretty hungover at the time and desperately needed to plug my gut.  It was between this and a deli I saw a little bit down the way but pizza always, always sounds good so I made my decision.  In my mind, in a fight between a pizza and a sandwich, the pizza would always win because it has the power of molten-hot cheese and pepperoni shields.

Yay:  It was like $6 bucks for a big slice of pizza and a salad and a drink.  That's a really, really good deal.  The salad that I got wasn't like an amazing salad but it had onions on it and croutons and had a strong flavor.  It wasn't bad.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, ""Throw a salad together super quick and cheap,"" and I got that salad, I'd give it a B.

Nay:  The pizza was not so good.  But, you know, it was pizza and pizza is hard to fuck up so it was salvageable.  The big problem was that it was so greasy.  I mean the pizza sweat grease like a fat man's back.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, ""Make me a cheap ass piece of pizza that tastes good,"" I'd give this slice of pizza like a C.  I choked that shit down though and washed it down with salad and raspberry iced tea.

So, you know, the pizza wasn't great, but after I got done eating I felt a lot better.  I had the strength and energy to check out Comicon for the rest of the day.  I geeked out good.",high
"Impressive dinner tonight!  However, it was a packed house, and it took over an hour for my Panang Curry to arrive.  While I was a part of a large group of about 14, our particular group had 6 people.  One tablemate's entree (Ginger veggie stir-fry?) arrived at least 20 minutes before the second tablemate saw hers (Yellow Curry).  It was at least another ten minutes before the third tablemate saw his, and so on...  I was able to sample my neighbors' dishes of Spicy Catfish (battered and fried catfish topped w/ bell peppers, basil, and spicy red curry sauce) and Swimming Rama w/ pork (topped w/ peanut sauce over steamed veggies).  All three were AMAZING!  I'll definitely order the Rama and the catfish next time!!!

Didi, our server, moved quickly, was efficient, and attentive, and was even helpful in suggesting alternate selections to those who had never had Thai food before.  She even warned tablemate Ericka, who'd only recently discovered peanut butter as an entree ingredient, that she'd either love or hate the Rama.  We were thankful that she rolled the dice and ordered it, anyway.

I hope that the kitchen crew can work out the kinks as far as pacing goes-I hope that by next visit I can up the review back to five stars!!

Ooh, do try the coconut ice cream w/ embedded grated coconut!  Not as good as Yupha's homemade coconut ice cream, but still  quite delightful :)",high
"Finally was able to make it here for breakfast. My opinion, I will NOT be back. As we were walking up to the place, I said ""O now this is the kind of place we should be taking our out of town visitors."". Well, on 2nd thought, NO. We went today, a weds, there was no wait and we were seated promptly. We were informed that the beverages was self serve as far as coffee, water, tea and lemonade goes. We started with tea-dislike, then lemonade-dislike. And did I mention we self served ourselves in a 12 oz cup with a price of $2.75, WOW! If it was to our liking, Id say that is still steep for a self serve drink in a 12oz cup. He had the monte cristo, which he liked but was not blown away for the price. I had the french toast and it was only ok. I also ordered a side of sausage that i DISLIKED and it was $4 for I think 2 links, WOW. And once our food came, the flys were EVERYHWERE. I kid you not when I say I couldnt wait to get outta there. I left very disappointed, and hungry. Will never return or recommend. But hey, try it for yourself, you may like it. I just think it was too high priced for what we got.",low
"Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.

After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the ""OPEN"" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected ""Butai"").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said ""We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..."" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...  

When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.  

I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.  

Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.",low

debbie in the events office as well as the staff she sent us to be of service throughout the event were wonderful.

food was delicious - we ordered buffet style (chicken milanese, sirloin steak, appetizers, and beverages) for about 150 people. 

the tech staff was very helpful in setting up our equipment for a slide show as well as providing equipment for us to play our own music at the event.

servers were polite and accomodating to any of the guests' requests.
and the facility is beautiful.

they even let me go super early in the morning being the type A personality i am to decorate myself and set things up.

overall wonderful experience with this resort and its staff. would love to host another event here in the future.

"It's been awhile since this place was reviewed... and probably just as long since my last visit.  In the last few months (or possibly more), this restaurant changed names (it was previously 'The Counter') and cleared out the retail boutique area to make room for more seating.

Future yelper Nancie S suggested we meet for lunch here today, and I was impressed with the changes.  By no means is Chloe's Corner a high end restaurant... it's more like a retro diner with a modern feel.  It's the kind of place you order at the counter and pay for it, and then they bring your food to your table when it's ready.  It's also great for those who want to pick up something quick on the go...

We both ordered the chopped salad and a side of toasted cranberry walnut bread.  It was really tasty!  You can tell they use high quality ingredients... the salad is a unique combination of field greens, turkey, bleu cheese, walnuts, and grapes with poppyseed dressing.  I would for sure order it again although the tuna melt looked pretty amazing too!  There are several other 'classic' items on the menu such as grilled cheese, tomato soup, milkshakes, etc...

Even more impressive than the lunch was the fact that I found a parking spot right away at Kierland and I left without going into one single store.  I'm so proud of myself for that... any fellow shop-a-holics know how hard that can be!

Although I did like this place when it was ""The Counter,"" it looks to me like the change that Fox Restaurant Concepts made to this restaurant was a good one!",high
"This was a nice casino experience.  It wasn't as loud as Las Vegas.  The food was really greasy and made me a bit sick.

"Our 1st visit to Renegade Canteen last night.  We made reservations and were a little late getting there,  but they had our table waiting which was nice because the place was packed.  Atmosphere is very nice.  Beautiful building and a nice layout.  Next time we plan to eat in the bar.  We had to try Bob's Big Burger and what a big burger it was!  Quality meat (bacon was to die for).  Big onion, big tomato.  What more could you ask for?  Mr. McGrath was in the restaurant and he came by our table to say hello and ask if we were enjoying ourselves.  Great guy!  And our waiter was very attentive (not pushy) but always seemed to show up at the right time.

We plan on going back for sure.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.

Catch Chef McGrath on Channel 8 PBS ""Check Please, Arizona"".  He does a good job and watching the show makes you hungry.

Thanks Renegade Canteen for having us.",high

"I've only eaten the buffet here and it was good but nothing special.  To be fair, most Indian buffets are pretty similar, it's only when you order from the menu that you see if the restaurant is really a stand-out.  So, I will update this review when I've gone there for dinner",high
"This place is essentially a copy of the old Father's Office (www.fathersoffice.com) in Brentwood, CA.  It took me a while to get over that fact and give it a decent try.  Among the things Delux has copied from FO is the famous ""Office Burger,"" which Delux calls the ""Delux Burger.""  They also bring out the fries in a shopping cart just like Father's Office.  What Delux fails to copy, however, is the quality of the food and the high-end nature of the original.  At FO, the wines changed weekly and are all incredibly rare selections.  The beers at FO also tend towards the more obscure.  Delux seems to concentrate almost exclusively on beers and does have a decent selection, but nothing you can't find elsewhere.  Wines are available, but as an afterthought, and definitely not of the quality served at FO.  For Phoenicians who never experienced the joys associated with the original Father's Office, you're missing out.  It's like being an Eric Clapton fan but not even knowing who Muddy Waters is.  But all the imitation aside, I have to say that Delux does a pretty good job with everything and they have taken the FO concept and adapted it to the PHX strip mall environment.  

Food wise, everything I have tried was ok.  They did change their sweet potato fries a year or two ago because the other ones weren't ""crispy"" enough.  The problem is that these new crispier ones have no flavor.  When they were testing out the new fries, the manager asked me and a friend to opine and we told him the truth: We said the new ones are flavorless.  I guess we were the only ones who thought so because they went ahead with that change.  That lost them 1 star from this review.  I would rather have the soggier more flavorful ones (who knows how they make these new ones so crispy anyways?).  

When I go here, it's almost always out of convenience and late at night.  Not many places of this caliber stay open until 2 am, so it's about all there is when you are in need of a late night meal in this part of town.  Their 2 star rating is based on: clearly knocking off one of my favorite places, Father's Office (minus 1 star) and for ignoring my feedback on the new crispy tasteless sweet potato fries (minus 1 star).  They also lose a star for retaining the FO prices but substituting Phoenix strip mall quality.",high
"Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot, and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times... their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times... My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact. Of course, no one asked if we had been helped, until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us. 

Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server. I know several people saw us just sitting there, the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not. 

This last experience, was about a year after the last. I thought maybe they would have changed. I most definitely thought wrong! We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time. However, our food took FOREVER! Literally, it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta. I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room). The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was. 

Overall, I will never go to that restaurant again.",low

"The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, ""What the hell? Where has this been my whole life?"" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago. 

Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap? Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better.",high

I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews. The service is good. We didn't have to wait but I didn't like the food I ordered. I had a salmon with caper butter sauce. The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.,low

Coffee is the main focus here, at least by decor and by what most people were drinking this morning, and you can't resist noticing the craft beer taps as you enter the place.

"I have to admit: I am impressed.

I have been to a few vegan-only-menu restaurants and I was... underwhelmed. Nothing against the raw food movement, but unless it is a raw-specific place, I expect more creativity. Show me what food can do, be, taste like. Don't just cut it up and toss it on a plate.

Four of us came in to eat on a Saturday and the place was PACKED. A good sign, surely, AND it was a really great mix of demographics: young and old, many nationalities, singles, couples, families... we liked that it had a wide appeal.

The place smelled fantastic, too, so we started perusing the menu long before we had a table to sit at. We waited about ten minutes for a table. It's a bit like a cafeteria in that you order and pay at the counter, and the food is brought to your table.

While we waited we were given a bowl of the ""house soup"" which, basically, was warm carrot water with a piece of carrot or two and some tiny, tiny mushrooms. We all agreed that it needed more of a broth flavor (more types of veg? more mushrooms?), but it was tasty enough and definitely whet our appetites for more.

The spring rolls were really good but needed more. As we removed the peanuts for my friend, I ""blame"" this on us... I will have to have them with the peanuts next time.

The crispy rolls were spiced and savory and light and perfectly crispy. 

My favorite had to be the Pate Chaude. Flaky, savory with a bite from a wonderful combination of spices, and a meatiness from the mushrooms that made us think a die-hard carnivore in our lives may not miss the meat if he were to eat it. THE dish of the day, hands down.

The curries were a bit bland (Save-Planet and Divine Curry Noodles). They were fine, OK, but nothing that made us think we'd come just for that. Much better elsewhere.

The Gracious Spicy Noodle soup was really tasty but it needed a tad more spice. With spicy in the name, we expected more. 

Some stuff is pretty basic: the sushi rolls are basic veggie sushi rolls. The rainbow salad is a tasty but commonplace cabbage and carrot slaw. The fried rice was fried rice. All yummy, all fine to eat, but nothing spectacular, different, or altogether exciting. Basic isn't bad.

Four stars for the surprising and amazing pate chaude and the rolls, for sure. Ideally, 3.5 stars this trip, but I rounded up for the good parts. 

Couldn't go five stars for two reasons: too many items were just basic and the service is slooooooooow. 20+ minutes for fried rice (that we had to ask about)? 25+ minutes for some soup? It was a crap shoot as to what was going to be delivered and when. While they were swamped when we came in, the crowd was thinning out for their afternoon down time (they close from 3p-5p). Overall, our lunch took over 2 hours, most of it waiting on dishes to come out. No bueno if you have other plans that day.

So... tasty, some major standouts, some ""meh, I've had this before."" We *WILL* absolutely go back to give the menu more of a chance to wow us; the ones that knocked us off our feet are worth the return. (Hopefully it's delivered a little faster this time!).",high
"Got together with Mike C. to go out to a Thanksgiving Buffet today.  We tried for Golden Corral down the street in Gilbert but the line was way outside, so we came up here where there was also a wait, but shorter.  It was good, as always, but there were some negatives this time:

*  The soups:  There was an ordinary Corn Chowder, a weak Cream of Broccoli, & ordinary Chicken Noodle.  They should have done better than this for Thanksgiving.

*  There was no cottage cheese.  (They don't always have it, but at these prices they should have some today.)

*  There was turkey, but breast meat only & no dressing!

*  Over at the dessert bar there was no hot fudge (& it looked not as if it had run out, but rather that they just didn't offer any today).

*  There were no sundae cups.  I had to go over & get a soup bowl to make a sundae.

*  There was Hot Lava Cake (or ""Hot Fudge Cake"" I think they call it here), but it was sorely lacking in lava!

Thus, it's down to 2 Stars for this restaurant that wasn't as good as it should have been for the money.

"I finally got the chance to visit Lola on my way home from a poetry reading at the Phoenix Art Museum Last night..(Side note: If you get the chance to see Aaron Johnson read, do so.)

I somehow feel the need to appologize for the lack of stars to all of you who seem to love this place. I would certainly be willing to give it another try but I was not impressed.

First the music is loud, and therefore everyone talking in the place turns up the volume and as my girlfriend and I were seated across from each other at the communal table we could barely reach to share the food let alone hear each other.

Why are the tables so big if the food is so small? Maybe I am a bit of a glutton, but for 8 dollars I essentially ate a mushroom for dinner...Don't get me wrong it was tasty, and I understand Tapas are appetizers, but 8 dollars? I was disapointed. I used to go to Firefly in Vegas and it was cheaper and tastier.

We just wanted to try this place and move on someplace quieter, but I was really looking forward to it...We decided not to have drinks and simply share one thing so we could get to said quieter place before it got too late...I think because we ordered so little, the waitress considered us a waste as far as her tips were concerned and therefore seemed not so friendly...and those little bitty glasses of water they bring...I drank immediately and it was never refilled. 

I was overall not impressed by anything except a patron's sweet ass Salvador Dali Mustache. I can see the charm there and I probably will give it another shot but based on this trip 2 stars is fairer than fair.",high
"I'm not one for hyperbole, but this may have been

THE  BEST      MEAL      OF   MY       LIFE!!!!

I'd like to hold an awards show and give out lifetime achievement trophies to the following individuals:

1.  To the chef, who exceeded my expectations again and again. The Stetson salad, wild boar meatballs, and Korean-style BBQ short ribs (and that killer side of au-gratin brussel sprouts) and you, sir, have won my heart and my stomach.  I want to fill a swimming pool with that BBQ sauce!

2.  To our server, Richard.  Your genuine excitement for the food was a nice change from past servers reluctant to give a real recommendation.  You were cordial and professional and made sure we enjoyed our time with you.  I don't know, I may name my unborn child after you in tribute.

3.  To the pastry chef, Country.  Your bread pudding was exceptional, but what a surprise, your ice creams were downright dreamy!  The scoop of brown butter ice cream took my tastebuds on a field trip through chilled fields of chocolate truffles.

"Really great burgers...I would hope so with a name like Smashburger. This location is really good, so it gets busy at lunch time. Waiting is a bit of a pain, but it's typically not too long. The food takes a few minutes too, which is a positive in my book. The food here feels a lot fresher and better than fast food, though if you've seen their burgers, it's not a place that's super healthy.

They also offer chicken sandwiches (crispy or grilled), and salads, so there are some healthier options, but the winners here are the burgers and fries. Definitely try the smash fries. Tossed in olive oil, garlic and rosemary, they are delicious. Burgers are really good and juicy, and the ingredients they use seem fresh.

Cons are the long lines, and it's also not a place where you'll be in and out in 15 minutes. It's also not inexpensive. A burger, fries and a drink will run you $10-11, which seems high for ""fast food"", though I think it's worth it. What's nice though, is that you sit down with your number and they bring you your food, and they'll bus your table, so it feels like a combo of fast and full service...I suppose this is a perfect example of ""fast casual"". 

It's pretty close to my office, so I'll be back often. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area and craving a burger.",high

If I didn't live a $40 cab ride away (one-way) I'd come here way more often. 

Lots of huge flat panel tvs and plenty of seating. It gets packed on weekends but the place is pretty big so it never feels overwhelmingly crowded. 

This is not a good place to dance. There is actually no dance floor. But maybe that won't stop you or I after a few drinks...",high
"I am a big fan of both the Vig and the Uptown Vig, but I like the Uptown Vig only because there is never any wait for a table.  Though I am sure the Uptown would prefer some wait because that would mean more people, more money, etc.

Back to the Uptown: great trendy layout with a sweet indoor patio that gives the illusion of being outside without the sweltering heat or desert night cold.  The menu is eclectic drawing inspiration from Thai, Indian, American and Mexican cuisines.  My favorite are the Nachos.  They are ginormous and packed with every ingredient you might ever want topping chips.  The sweet potato fries are also delightful.

They have a few specials, which elude me now, but I remember one involves 20 bucks for wine and an appetizer.  Also they have Hoegaarden on tap which is a plus.",high
"I made it to China King at 2:40 pm on a Sunday and I called ahead expressing a desire to have a late Dim Sum lunch. However, once we arrived they only had a five items to try. I was bummed, but I will make sure I go early next time so I can here what everyone raves about. My average Singapore vermicelli was a poor substitute, but I will arrive earlier next week so I don't interrupt staff meal. That seemed to be the focus when we there, as service was neglectful and quite indifferent.

Also, I found a hair in my food, but why complain when they really don't care if you're there or not.",high
"I drove by last night and noticed the sign and decided I needed to check it out. So I stopped by for a late lunch and was the only one in the place which made for some nice time to chat with the owner and her mother, who was the one whipping up the great food in the kitchen. 

They've only been open since February and had relied on fliers and the painted signs on the windows to attract customers. While I was there, supremely enjoying the chicken curry roti, a few other people came in because they drove by and saw the sign. 

I couldn't decide between the jerk chicken or the curry for my roti, so I was given samples of both. I thought the jerk chicken was a little too hot for me, but the curry still was able to clear out my sinuses. Wow - slow burn! I was told they could tone down the heat upon request. I'm not sure I'd want to ruin the experience, though. 

The menu looked interesting - goat curry, oxtail - along with the jerk and the curry options. I opted for the guava nectar to drink (so yummy!). 

This is in my neighborhood so I'll definitely be back to try some more. The atmosphere was comfortable and I was encouraged to linger longer, but I needed to get on with my day. The food and the music piped in made me feel like I took a mini-vacation. Nice.",high
"Yes, as the other reviewers have stated, there are always extremely long lines and surly attendants at this location.  However, they have two automated machines where you can do almost everything you need to do without interacting with a human at all.  The machines are super easy to use and you can pay by credit card and it just prints out your label.  Not all post offices have these so it is a definite plus.

Also, if you have pre-paid envelopes or just regular stamped letters, there is a drive thru when you pull into the parking lot where you can go and just drop them in the boxes without even getting out of the car.  I know that you could take these items anywhere but I have found that they get where they are going at least a day faster by dropping them at this post office since it is the main sorting facility for our zip code.  Very important when you are a Netflix addict.",high
"Tradition at it's most... er.... um.... traditional. Every time i eat here i feel like i have been transported to any number of old family owned steakhouses on the North Shore of Long Island, or Brooklyn. The plush red velvet, the dark wood and button tufted leather... The place just screams STUFFY BUSINESS LUNCH. My first experience here was with a bunch of lawyer friends who were dying for meatloaf or a steak with creamed spinach... 

The entrance is through the kitchen. That may seem a little odd, but I'd bet it sells dinners. Who can resist the wonderful aroma. By the time you reach your table, you crave rare beef, as red as the decor. 

It's the kind of place where you forgo the trendy drinks and have a Scotch with a splash,or a Rob Roy before dinner. The steaks are perfectly prepared, the garlic mashed potatoes are wonderful. I love the place. It isn't cheap, and admittedly, i have never paid for my own meal there. It has always been a treat from some friend who wears a suit to work, or some more traditional back easterner who wants to share their bit of meat and potato lovers heaven.",high

"7/07/10

Don't get me wrong, I still love JFG; I just didn't care for its BBQ pulled pork sandwich and fries.  The coleslaw was good, but not so fantastic that it's worth the pain after.  I thought that the pork had too much of the cloyingly-sweet sauce.  Wasn't so sweet when paired w/ the garlic toast points.  However, if you look at the included photo, you'll see that the two pieces of bread were under the pork, and therefore completely saturated w/ sauce.  I like accompanying bread to be crispy/crusty (love that crunch!), so all I had to enjoy that afternoon w/ the pork was the part that stuck out from under all that sauced meat!  What a waste (tsk, tsk)!  The boat of fries was just a complete soggy mess.  I should've asked them to sub sweet potato fries instead, but why must I pay extra to get a perfectly crisped product?  Then again, one (wo)man's treasure is another (wo)man's trash, and vice-versa, eh?

Today wasn't a great day for me w/ regards to Mr. Johnston's two restaurants (see my ""recent"" Coffee Shop review).  I hope my next visit to a Johnston concept yields a happier adventure!",high

"What a crap airline!  If I could give them zero stars I would.  I flew from Phoenix to Denver to New Orleans.  The check-in people, gate staff and flight attendants were rude and abrupt, the flights ALL left at least 45 minutes late, it was the worst flying experience I've had.  I was fortunate thta my Denver back to Phoenix leg was US Airways...never thought I'd say ""Thank you US Airwarys"" for at least that part of the flight not being a nightmare!  I will never fly United again!",low
"Oh, Sushi Brokers...what happened to you?! This used to be my go-to place for great ambience and delish sushi.  We ate there Friday night for the first time in a long time and they have significantly raised their prices and the sushi was subpar at best! $90 for 3 rolls and 3 cocktails. Grrrr....frustrating!",high
"Amazing quesadillas !!!! I had the steak, mushroom, and cheese as recommended by our server and man was I impressed! They are not the standard kind that I am used to. Fried and covered in lettuce and green sauce. The al pastor burrito was so hot and tasty as well. This is now my new favorite cheap delicious mexican joint! I wish the salsas were better and didnt all light my mouth on fire but hey, the food is awesome anyway and didnt need the salsas.",high
I went to Kens Nails on Tatum a couple weeks ago and finally found my go-to nail place! The staff was friendly and helpful and it's a nicely decorated spa. I went in to get a mani/pedi and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of service. Mandy was my manicurist and she was wonderful. I got the gel nail manicure which was only $30 and the spa pedi which was only $32 and amazing! I am looking forward to going back.,high
"If I could give zero stars, I would.  I have never spent more time looking for a bar than I have looking for this. And not like a cool underground dance club in L.A.  When we finally found this sh*thole sandwiched between two vacant businesses, it was barely visible.  The sign for it looked like it was written with a sharpie on a piece of cardboard and someone duct tapped a flashlight to it.  Before we even entered the bar, as my friend and I were walking up two redneck bikers whispered, ""Fags"" as we walked by them.  I don't think these were the kind of guys you argued with so I let it go.  When we entered the bar I noticed several ""No firearms"" signs plastered on the walls.  I'm assuming they've had a problem with this before.  Remember that scene in the Blues Brothers where they go to the country bar and get the look of death from the patrons?  That's how I felt.  The decor of this bar was interesting.  It looked as if they got the tables and chairs from an old 70s Vegas casino.  The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so getting a seat is pretty much impossible.  We went to the bar to do some karaoke, but apparently they also sell crappy jewelry for some reason?  Weird.  I've also never heard so much cussing from karaoke singers.  One of the drunken hicks actually got into a shouting match with one of the morbidly obese toothless tattooed bicker chicks where they argued who was the bitch and who was the pussy.  Halfway through my beer, my friends showed up and they refused to go inside so I ran away and never looked back.  TIP: If you go here wear a black leather jacket, bandana and Harley Davidson gear.",low
"I'm glad that living in the southwest has benefits other than excessive use of cacti in home decor. One of those benefits is the food served at Z'Tejas, and I will gladly put up with any number of hanging serapes to get my hands on Tex-Mex. 

This is what you need to order (no exceptions): 

1. Drinks: Chambord Margarita 
2. Appetizer: Cornbread (so moist!) 
3. Entree: Seafood Enchiladas 
4. Dessert: Berry Cobbler. 

You will need to take a food coma after you have successfully finished all this food. But, and trust me on this one, you will finish it because everything they serve is addictive. I would have literally licked the cobbler pan if I was not in public.

"This place has it all. Fresh food. Vintage decor. Outdoor misting system for those uncomfortabley-sweaty summer days. Plenty of scooter parking. Beautiful shade trees (watch out for scorpions!). Oh and did I mention the food?

My favorite item by far has to be the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Tender grilled chicken breast smothered in tangy wing sauce nestled between a toasty bun that has been smeared with blue cheese and crunchy celery. It's heaven in a bite.

Coupled with a serving of Sweet Potato Fries, this is a party in your mouth and every taste bud is invited. (Even that anti-social one on the back of your tongue that doesn't know how to dance.)",high
"I stayed here for two nights the first week of April 2012.  Woot. Arizona weather really is the best. 

Overall, it was a nice place to stay. Purdy too. I bought a deal on Hotwire and wasn't sure what hotel I was booking until I paid, and it turned out to be this resort.  Overall, very satisfied for the price I paid.  However, I do not think I would pay $200+ a night here.  At that point, I would say it's not worth it.

The entrance is gorgeous and nicely updated. Trendy, modern, yet warm. Love the lit deer heads.  I want them.  It feels like a high class resort when you first go through the entrance.  Once you head to the rooms though, it does seem like an older resort.  However, our room was nicely decorated and very clean so no complaints in that area.

If you are missing your pets from home, be sure to ask for a pet fish during your stay! I asked for one, well, I had to ask twice because they forgot the first time... But soon I had a goldfish in my room which I named Basil.  (Due to me becoming inebriated on one too many cucumber basil martini's... Don't judge)

As for the room/parking, it's very easy to park extremely close to the entrance to the rooms which we liked.  It was easy to navigate in and out as the resort is fairly small.  The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didn't really care either way about.  It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us.  However, I will say the bed sucked.  When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him.  They badly need to upgrade to better beds. While not uncomfortable per se, I don't enjoy feeling every teeny movement of my partners.

They had nice toiletries- C.O Bigelow.  I enjoyed those little aspects.

For an hour every evening they had free wine happy hour, which we did check out one of the evenings.  Hey, no one complains about Free Wine!!!  Nothing special, but it did the trick.

Hotel Bar: Had some kick ass cocktails.  Plenty of strength and tasty concoctions.

Biggest Bummer?  The pool area.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty. First appearances are good.  There is plenty of shade from large palms and such and there's an area for kiddies with sand.  However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests.  And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they aren't around, which is not cool.  Suggestion to hotel:  Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no one's been sitting there for awhile?  It's not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all.  And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall.  Almost too much shade.  It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade.  It made me majorly pissy.  Sun is why I came to AZ.

Overall, a great place close to downtown Scottsdale and a walk away from the mall. Perfect for those who want to spend time near the action.  If you can get a good deal here, it's worth the stay. Plus, they have a free shuttle if you want to go somewhere a few  miles from of the place.  (so you can drink and have a driver)",high
"I went out last night in search of a restaurant with good soup, but instead decided to try Texas Roadhouse. As soon as you walk in, you feel welcomed and right at home. The staff are all smiling and welcoming you, and just the atmosphere of the place was great! Roasted peanuts await you at your table, along with some delicious bread! I had a bacon cheese burger, which I could only finish half, while my husband had a steak that he actually enjoyed! Our waitress kept up with the drinks and checked up on us enough, but not to much to where she was bothering. All in all the service and food was great! I will definitely recommend it to others, and be back myself!",high
I live in north Phoenix and believe me there needs to be a lot more quality dining out here. This is a gem. The atmosphere is tops. The food is consistent. The management actually cares. It's just a cool place all the way around! A lot of corporate establishments seem to yank popular things off the menu cause it's just not trendy anymore. Every single thing I have had at this place was delicious! Not one other restaurant has pulled that off. A place you can actually count on for a good evening. High five to the Yard house!,high
"Meh.  Service was friendly, and the atmosphere is bright and festive, but it's pretty Americanized Mexican food.  I had a California burro ($9.49), which was a large size, and tasted OK, but for about 1/3 of the price and for about the same size, I can get a better tasting burro with the same type of ingredients at Los Favoritos.  I've also had dishes with their Baja sauce, which tends to be too heavy tasting for me.",low
"Reasons to Heart: Breakfast All Day, Self-Serve Coffee, Modern Hip Decor, NYT, Cholula, Inter-generational Friendly

Reasons You May Dislike: BUTTER PARTY, Small Menu, Awkward Market, Bizarre Combo of Self-Serve/Service that is NOT Apparent, Kid Friendly

Reasons to Be Here: Your friends you lost to baby-making Suburbs, IKEA, You are Near the I-10 and Do Not Feel like Sushi, Ace Hardware, You want B-fest after 10:30am on a Weekday, Dad Wants Burger, you Want Organic Local yogurt/parfait

First time here with my friend's parents, as we walked up, I noticed an antique wooden bench with multiple kinds of newspapers, including NYT, held down by an old iron and an Open sign with neon on a skateboard. Whoa. What a liberal hip person coding of an entrance if I ever saw one! Inside, a bright modern airy space with concrete floors, exposed ceiling beams, bright green walls and exposed stainless steel industrial kitchen, I was super impressed by the brightness the huge windows gave the place as well as the cutting edge furniture. The menus are charming chalkboard options that have breakfast all day, kid's menu and lunch served after 11am. All priced between $4-$11, alas there are vegetarian options but this is NOT a butter free place. In fact, it is a fucking BUTTER PARTY. So get your LacTaid if you can do it!

The slightly hipster staff (the guys look like that dude who played Keats in Bright Star) are amiable at the counter but after ordering my garden veggie sammie I was dismayed to realize they had pastry cases hidden in the counter (you just basically look up the whole time then realize after swiping your debit card your other options). Also the drink menu is awkwardly displayed to the far right of the main menus (um, I would've wanted a soy latte instead of coffee...). After paying at the register, there is the bizarre scramble of figuring out what you have to get yourself.

There is a large bevy cooler that has wine, beer, soda, juice, water, etc and was a very healthy selection (not a poor one at all). Awkwardly placed is the water, iced tea and coffee station where people are trying to read the menu before ordering. Most tables are four person tables with two people seating around the windows and large community tables towards the L-shaped back, along with bar/counter seating that views the cooks station. Each time I went I ended up at the same four-person table near the condiment table stocked w/catsup, Sriracha, Cholula hot sauce (oh shit). 

My first experience I got ginger beer and a veggie sandwich. Now, as a vegetarian for over 12 years, and a lactose-intolerant for over 5 years, my expectations were way low. Instead, I was fucking IMPRESSED. The bread ended up soggy due to the herbs mayonaisse cream dill sauce thing with incredible local roasted veggies with really good bread. OMFG. I mean seriously, I can't remember much of the meal cause my brain went somewhere spiritual. I also got the fresh fruit on the side, and a great deal with fresh berries, grapes, kiwi, etc. I managed to fit it all in my tummy (and felt def. overstuffed-I should've kept 1/2 of it). My companions had the pulled pork sandwich and killed it, the other had pancakes.

Today, I woke up and I wanted breakfest. Not Essence, Gallo Blanco, Lux, Wildflower, def. NOT Harlows, I wanted fancy pants American style breakfast I hadn't had a billion times before. Located right off the I-10, it's a fast drive from Tempe, and I didn't know what to expect for a crowd around 10:30 on a Tuesday. Turns out, Tim and I were def. the median age here. Mostly older patrons, couples, families, business deals, co-workers, moms with toddlers (they have plenty of nice high-chairs, btw). I had to get the pancakes ($6) w/fruit ($1) and side of potatoes ($3) and coffee. Tim got the rotassarie chicken with grilled corn and hand cut french fries (I think under $10). Seating was easy, food came out together within 15 minutes. The pancakes were delicate, almost crepe like, with a buttermilk taste but not too cinnamony and a little dry and thin (in a good way-sops up the butter and syrup). The serving of fruit on top was a little small, but all good quality, the potatoes were home-made style with sauted onions, skins still on.  His plate was huge with a grilled corn, the fries still had the skin on, and the chicken looked great and very greasy (which he killed). We had to remember to get our own utensils, napkins, and our own drinks but the staff checked in periodically and after finishing our plates, the dirty dishes sat around for 5 minutes, I believe due to the insane lunch rush that came in! Seriously, the place exploded! I was happy Tim had bought the cookies he eyed earlier so we skidaddled after using the nice, clean bathrooms. 

Now, eating yummers Blondie cookie and chocolate chip cookies that are greased through the paper bag, I think I will have to ride my bike here to justify the butter party celebration!",low

The staff was totally rude. Before we went, we called to check the hours. The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information. 

The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special. If you're going to have mediocre food, you better have exceptional service. Double fail.",low
"This is a difficult review to write.  My family started eating here when they first opened. We were a once a week customer. Very happy with the food and service, pizza is delicious. 
Then one evening, we placed our order asking for the special we always get, a 2 pizza deal.
When we received our order, they placed 2 medium pizzas on our table. I immediately asked about the pizza size as we had always received 2 large pizzas as advertised.  It turns out they have 2 specials, a 2 medium pizza deal and a 2 large pizza deal.
The employee never asked which deal and the fact that we were there with 5 people should have prompted them to ask me to specify which deal.
I spoke to the owner of this location he agreed to make us another medium pizza to make up the size difference to which I agreed to.
Nearly 10 minutes later, the owner came to our table and told us that if he made us another pizza, he was going to have to charge us for it.
I refused and now nearly 2 years later, we have chosen not to return to this establishment. 
My money is important to me and it should be as important to any business, especially a small local business...
I now choose a place slightly further away, but one that appreciates its customers.
Pizza - delicious
Customer appreciation - needs improvement
Hope some changes have been made over the last couple of years",low
"My absolute favorite thing about summer in Scottsdale is that restaurants and hotels get SUPER cheap and do every night happy hours. Literally, best Happy Hour in South Scottsdale, by far. I originally wanted to eat at Culinary Drop Out, but the line was long and I was STARVING. Went into Wildfish, because even though I had never eaten there, and was left without my Bible of Yelp, I took a chance since I had eaten at its North Scottsdale, Big Brother location, Eddie V's, dozens of times. The menu is very similar to Eddie V's, but I would say, a bit trendier. Me and my man had appetizers and I had a $5 Mojito, and it was delicious. I had ahi tuna tar tar, a green salad with shrimp, shrimp cocktail, and by far, the best calamari I had ever had. It was like, salty, sweet, crunchy, and had cashews on it. I couldn't tell if I was eating calamari, or a dessert! Go for Happy hour FOR SURE. Great atmosphere, too...",low
"I've been to the Greene House many times. In general, I think it's pretty good. I go mostly for lunch, and I order from the sandwiches & salads typically.Tonight was no different - had a sandwich.

I went with my brother as a belated bday celebration. Ordered the roast beef sandwich with a side salad instead of fries. Had the pineapple rum cake for dessert.

The first few times I ate at the Greene House, I was really impressed. I thought the food and service was very good. Over time, I've become less impressed. Tonight, the service was great - loved my server. Everything worked like a well-oiled machine. Good coordination between the staff, and we were kept well supplied throughout dinner.

The food is not consistent. That's a big issue I have with restaurants in general. Maybe I'm harsh, but I really believe being inconsistent knocks a place down a few notches. The problem with inconsistency is that you don't know what you're going to get. If a place is consistently mediocre, at least I know I'm going to get mediocre.

Tonight the real downer to the whole meal was the salad. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was not great either - bun too big compared to the amount of meat and other filling items on the sandwich, not enough meat - but the side salad was really awful. First, if I moved the salad on my plate, there was a big pool of dressing on my plate. There is such a thing as a properly dressed salad, and this was not it. Way too much dressing. I might have been ok with that had the dressing been very good... which it wasn't. The balsamic dressing was too sweet, and was under seasoned (definitely needed more salt).

The dessert was good. It wasn't great... but it was good. The rum cake, in my opinion, was too dry. Maybe the ridiculously large scoop of gelato is supposed to compensate for that, but I'd prefer a more moist cake and less gelato. I'm also not a huge fan of places where the dessert is almost as big (if not bigger) than the entree. Give me a couple bites of something amazing rather than a huge plate of something mediocre. I felt that this dessert fell into the later category.

I'm going to admit that this is only the second time I've ever had dessert at The Greene House, so I won't pass judgement on it's entire dessert menu, but I'll say the couple times I've been there, the dessert/entree ratio was way out of whack for my liking.",low

":( I really wanted to like this place. I thoroughly enjoyed the farm, but I will review it separately. We were greeted by a busy waiter who quickly pointed to self-serve drinks (coffee, tea, water and lemonade) and ran off. We helped ourselves to some coffee and lemonade before we received our menus which stated that each drink was $2.75. I ordered the white truffled scrambled egg skillet (white truffles are my fave). I did not detect one bit of truffle essence in this dish. My fiance ordered the Cowboy Breakfast. It was like watered down chili with and egg on top. No great. The concept is great, but the way in which the food is prepared is super disappointing.",high
"They had amazingly quick service during lunch! The servers were VERY polite, almost to the point of being obnoxious. I ordered the daily special--bacon cheeseburger--which came out hot, fresh, and delicious, though the fries were heavily over-salted.

"I'm a bit of a snob, I admit it. I generally prefer the full-service pamper me kind of salons that charge an arm and a leg. But times are tight - and I want my nails and my money. 

Enter Biagio. 

When you first walk into Biagio you would think you had walked into a fancy day spa. But when you read the prices, you wonder how they can stay in business. A ""spa"" pedicure, one of the most expensive treatments, is a whopping $49 (I say whopping with a sense of sarcasm). Not only do you get a great pedicure (best I've EVER received), but you get a leg and neck massage (yes the chairs are massage chairs, but real hands give you a real massage). 

A ""spa"" manicure, which also comes with a neck massage, is $25. 

The technicians are very nice, the store is immaculate, the tools are all sterilized, and the treatments are very high quality (even for a snob like me). Plus the atmosphere makes you feel like you are at a spa, not a strip-mall dive nail salon. 

I highly recommend Biagio. I have been there several times, and plan to go back often.",high

"I recently went to my first First Friday (and my first trip to downtown Phoenix). After a few hours at the Phoenix Art Museum, friends and I hopped on the light rail and tried a new restaurant. Enter The Breadfruit.

Easy to find (sign on the street corner) on a charming and quiet little street sits The Breadfruit with a hostess standing out front greeting guests. You can see the very intimate seating area from the street and it was packed (a good thing for 8:30pm on a Friday night). We sat and waited outside at the cute little tables (way too hot to eat a full meal outside). We were offered menus to peruse while we waited about 10 minutes for a table.

Inside, we ordered two mixed drinks (a mojito vanilla for me). They were strong and very good. The mojito was very minty and refreshing and my mojito-loving friend said he should have ordered a mojito. (Read: Get a mojito.)

The Food: We split a tilapia patty (very spicy!) for an appetizer. (Patties are Jamaican empanadas.) 
I had the coconut curried tofu with rice and peas, ripe plantains, and veggies. This is the one of the best tofu dishes I have ever had. My only complaint is that Breadfruit needs to have more plantains per plate. They are so good!
One friend had the curried chicken and dumpling with a green banana, veggies, plantains, and a side order of rice and peas. Although he didn't like the whole wheat dumpling, he loved the curry sauce and the green banana. He called the sauce ""delectable."" 

Overall, this is a great place. Small, but great. The drinks are strong, the food is great, and the serve is prompt. Our only regrets are 1) not enough plantains and 2) we should have gotten dessert.",low
"When my mom suggested we eat at a simple casual Mexican restaurant for her birthday/my brother's grad school graduation celebration, I was a little surprised. She herself has only been in one other Mexican restaurant years ago and loved it...no wait, I take that back. She's been in one other one but did not enjoy it as much as the first time. Eh. Anyhoo...My brother suggested Arriba because it is one of his favorite restaurants. (Note: I keep encouraging him to yelp about his favorite places in Phoenix since he lives there.) 

It was not terribly crowded for a Saturday afternoon, which was nice. I was pleased to learn that they have brunch options which is served until 4 PM on the weekends, if I recall. Up until the restaurant, I had trouble deciding what I wanted to eat since I had gained some weight being around family....eh, that happens right? I opted for the make your own omelet, and it came with beans and some potatoes. The potatoes were bland and needed a little salt for flavor. My dad who has never stepped in a Mexican restaurant, only because he is not a huge fan or an expert in Mexican cuisine, enjoyed his carne asada and rice. His plate was CLEAN! He did say he would come back again, and for my dad to say that is a good thing. My mom and brother shared some a lot of food, but honestly I was not paying attention to what they ordered. Oh and for dessert? We had 3 orders of the flan. I still stand by that my mom makes the best leche flan ever, but the one at Arriba was just as tasty. I think the cinnamon sprinkles help. ;-)  

Overall, I would have to say that we as a family enjoyed this place. Sadly, our trip in Phoenix was too short otherwise we would have gone back for at least a second round. We were seated right away and had great service. 

PS: The little to-go menus at the front are slightly different than the big menus at the table. I only know because my dad wanted to order something else from the small menu, and apparently it is only served during the week.",low
This is one of my favorite dive mexican places in Phoenix.... the place it pretty clean for a mexican place despite the shady looking outside.  Everytime that i have been there i always get the lunch specials... they are a ton of food and cheap (5 to 7 bucks for a large plate)...  The staff is very friendly and they get you in and out in a hurry... i have never been here for dinner... and not sure if i want to... i like being in that area during daylight hours.,high
"Excellent food! I do say the service isn't always the best, but the outcome of the food exceeds my expectations. Definitely recommend ordering the Artichoke Salad! Not what you'd expect out of a typical boring salad! Not just stuffed with a large amount of dull, boring lettuce, but filled with spices and tons of flavor.",high
"Food was tolerable, and tasteless.  The chips were actually tostadas that were extremely hard (almost stale) when eating. The entrees we ordered were bland.  The rice and beans had no flavor at all.  Maybe that is Baja style of food, but couldn't find the flavor anywhere.
The service was great and the ambiance was wonderful, but I don't think we'll be going to this place again.",high

"Impressive!   I dined at House of Tricks last week based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.    The aromas from other's food while sitting around at bar let me know I was in for a good meal.   I had trouble deciding what to eat, so I ordered 3 appetizers:   Seafood Stuffed Poblano Pepper, Veal 2 ways, and Braized Oxtail.    The bartender did a fantastic job of recommending the order in which i received my food - lightest to heaviest.

The ""Veal 2 Ways"" and ""Braised Oxtail"" were phenomenal.... a great combination of flavors and texture.   I think I'd put them both in my list of Top 10 dishes.   

I can't wait to travel back to Phoenix to eat there again.    I'll also add the I really like the atmosphere.   Very chill place, but elegant without being stuffy.",high

"They have a new and improved menu and added more Korean dishes. Very good!!! I've been there 4 times since they added the new menu, and it's been good every time. Very authentic Korean food. This is my favorite spot now!! 
The dishes I had so far:
Champong, Bulgogi, Sul-lung-tang, Neng-myun, Galbi, Yukgejang. All were very good. I can't wait to go back and try other food! Neng-myun (cold noodle) was especially good on muggy hot summer days.",high
"I really like this place! I've been wanting something like this to open for years, and now it's right around he corner! I'm a huge sushi fan, but I rarely have enough time during the week to stop and get any... Until now! This place is exactly what you'd hope for in a fast food sushi joint- helpful, friendly staff, good variety, good prices, and a clean dining space. I admit the whole make your own thing can be a little intimidating at first, just order one of their features rolls to get yourself started, then take off the training wheels on your next visit. You pick white or brown rice, meats, up to three veggies, and whatever sauces you want. The possibilities are endless! I've eaten enough sushi to know generally what works together, so I've been pretty happy with what I've come up with so far. The rolls are tasty and filling, and their traditional sides are great if you're super hungry. The only complaints I have are that the fish can be a little bland (even the so called 'spicy'), so you pretty much need to add a sauce of some kind. And some slices of fresh jalapeño! The parking lot is also a nightmare during weekday lunch hour, but I still think its worth it.",high
"Food was good, I had the Frutti de Mare with red sauce and boy it is spicy, so be warned. Everyone else ordered the Spaghetti Pie, which was the special that night. It was OK, my mom's is better. The service was good, but the wait for a table was over an hour. Of course if was a Saturday night and they are having Glendale Glitters so it was really busy. The pizza is good, I have had it before, I am not the biggest wood fire pizza fan, because it is always burned on the bottom!",high
"Nice atmosphere inside and out, with competent service.  BUT:
The food is not great.  It's very dull.  It reminds me of the food they serve at Chevy's but significantly more expensive.  I really have no desire to go back.  Scottsdale and any attempt at Ethnic food just doesn't mix.
Edit: Thanks to Yelp, I've discovered just a few places in Scottsdale with good ethnic food.  So now I really don't have any excuse to settle for Blue Adobe.",high

"So I was introduced to this station about 6 months ago by a fellow yelper who goes by Amy D... She has a wicked 8-10 spot on Tuesdays and I thoroughly enjoy listening to it on a weekly basis. Well, I was happened upon an opportunity... Nay! A priviledge of being a guest on this FABULOUS show and, being the attention whore that I have been labeled, I accepted.  I won't go into HOW I found myself being handed this prestigious title of KWSS Guest, but it involved a House of Clubs, Twitter, and a whole lot of begging (on my part)...

There I was... in the presence of 100% pure, raw (Can't decide which word to use ""Talent"" or ""Creativity"") and in a pretty bad ass studio. The Fabulous Amy and I discussed all the important topics of the nation/world and stumbled on numerous great ideas. One being a cure for cancer! Okay, we didn't discover a cure per say... but we did briefly talk about it.

The listeners were top notch and the atmosphere was professional, yet extremely comfortable. Plus, we actually got some free talent from a caller! He was awesome and sang me happy birthday.  It was sexy.

"Adorable bungalow building: Check
Quirky, cute, mismatched thrift-store dishware: Check
Delicious, buttery, flaky croissant breakfast sandwich: Check
Super friendly staff: Check

I went here for the first time yesterday and thought it was great. My friend and I both ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich which was super delicious and filling. Even though I knew that I'd be full from the sandwich, I couldn't resist snagging a brown butter scone when I saw it was the last one. Definitely made the right decision on that one, I'm a sucker for brown butter anything and the scone didn't disappoint. My friend ordered the Iced Toddy which was really good-- spiced but mellow. I ordered a latte and didn't like it quite as much. The owner was super friendly and remembered my name for the 1.5+ hrs. my friend and I lingered in the shop. He even gave me a (delicious) orange-zest filled strawberry muffin on the way out! If I didn't live so far away, I would be here all the time. As it is, I'll definitely be back soon.",high

"I don't often review places on Yelp because of the time commitment and because usually I am just looking for a good bite to eat. This time, though I feel I should if not to balance the ridiculous number of 4 and 5 stars bouncing around for this place.
The food was decent, and the atmosphere OK but seriously, how can this place cost as much as it does ($60+ for two people eating light)?? And how are people fawning all over it? I don't like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I can't seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis' class. 

I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price.

The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before. 

In the end I guess I would say if they would knock about $10 off of each plate, and cut some of the pretentious attitude, I would probably be offering a much  better review. 

I am not planning a return anytime soon.",high
"Oh, this was not good. Food not tasty. Overpriced not tasty food. If you're going to pay for a crab benedict, it should remotely taste like crab. And not be cold.

"Ok here is the deal with Red Devil Pizza.  The key to making pizza with crispy crust is to have ovens that great sufficiently hot.  That is why I like places with brick over pizza's. They don't use Brick Ovens at Red Devil but  I have been told that Red Devil has some really old pizza ovens that are not available any longer or hard to get.  I can't verify that, I don't even remember who told me that, maybe I read it some where.  Don't know if it is true or not. What I do know is that Red Devil is one of my favorite pizza place in the Valley.  Their pizza is consistently good.  Thin-Crisp and delicious.  I have had pasta's and salads there as well. They are fine, nothing to get excited about. But the Pizza at Red Devil is something I will stake my reputation on.  Actually I don't really have a reputation, but if I did I would lay it on the line for Red Devil Pizza. The long and short of it is, I am very passionate about their Pizza.  Period.",high
"We went out last night to the movies, and with an hour and a half to spare, we thought we had time to stop at this newish restaurant on the corner of Indian School and 24th St. It was a family owned place, baby in bassinet by the cashier, and absolutely no explanations of what the food is. Just strange names. We ordered and sat down. 35-40 minutes later, we realized the food still hadn't come and we'd never make it out to Scottsdale for our movie. So, disappointed, we took the food when it finally came and brought it home and ordered something up on Amazon. When I dove into the ""to go"" boxes, I stopped complaining. Man, that food was delicious. I ordered the Chicken Tikka, only because I pretty much knew what it would be, and it far beat my expectations. Our Chicken Kabab (ordered again because we knew what it would be) was delicious as well. To the owners, thank you for being here. We'll be back. Please develop something that describes the food, and make a non-egg version of the Naan bread please!

I was accused of training my wife for compensation and was told to leave the gym or he (Page the trainer) was going to call the cops.

Their lack of attention to the matter showed exactly what a customer of 6 years was worth.   You are treated only as a number.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.

"Went to Deer Garden Signature last night with my wife for dinner.  We had just returned from our Labor Day Week trip.  

I ordered a fish soup with dumpling, fish balls, and Korean crystal noodles.  My wife ordered preserved pork in a clay pot.  

The preserved pork in clay pot did not seem to interest me.  To me it looked like sausage with rice, and nothing particularly interesting.

The soup was actually pretty good.  My wife and I liked it much better.  

The only thing we think they could have done better is the following:

My wife and I were not exactly familiar with the style of food.  My wife is Vietnamese.  Maybe as part of the banner for the restaurant they should put Guandong Style Cuisine under the name.  

Otherwise the food is pretty good.

"After having been here a few times, I would say most of the reviews were dead on. The waiter was a fill in from another of the chain restaurants. The poor guy was serving everyone (which wasn't that busy) running around cool headed, apologetic and super fast paced.  

After ""gonging"" our announcement that we were there, a guy came to seat us about 10 or so minutes later. Sadly, we were told that he was the owner... Not too personable.  To be fair, they really never had great service in the few times I have been there. What keeps me infrequently coming back is their drunken noodles. They rock. We went also for the referral of the pumpkin curry entree. Both more than made up for the extremely slow service and normally unfriendly staff.

Summary of the rest of the reviews... Fish tank and others looked really clean, though I have seen them horrible before. Bathroom was atrocious... Filthy and gross. Waiter gave me some napkins and sent a guy out to buy more . Walk to the bathroom was down a dark hallway, thankfully again the waiter helped out with that... Poor guy!

I find it very unbelievable that on an emergency basis they can turn someone away who has a Costco optics patient for years. I recognize that she had a patient at the time but I said I could wait until after so she could at least take 5 minutes to tell me if I should go to a hospital or not.

"The Boulders was a first class experience all around.  

We stayed in a casita, which was one bedroom and had a sitting room w/fireplace (a letter on the table indicated they are no longer using the fireplaces for environmental concerns), a large bathroom and walk-in closet, and a patio with a table and four chairs.  For the ladies, there is a vanity with lighted mirror just off the bathroom.  My only small complaint about the casita was that the shower was a bit small.  The mini-bar seems to be a thing of the past, but the Boulders still features a well-stocked version with a half bottle of Cali wine, kettle cooked chips, water, soda and various liquor.  The villas were outrageous and would be great for a family reunion or that type of thing - multiple bedrooms, a large outdoor area for entertaining, with the garage (they're houses, really) converted to a bedroom.  If you're staying in a casita, it's a hike across the property to the villas - they'll take you in a shuttle bus.

The bar near the dining room was well-stocked with several single malts, and the standard cigar list.  Walk out back through the seating area, and you'll find the pool, framed by a gorgeous backdrop of a large boulder and waterfall.  A little cool for the pool in December, but it didn't seem to hamper others' enjoyment.

Looking forward to returning and enjoying more on-site amenities besides golf.  My girlfriend went to the spa for massage / pedicure and seemed pretty relaxed - what I gathered is that she enjoyed it.

This place used to be a great place to just hang and spend the morning on a weekend or weekday. Now it's over crowded and doesn't have that neighborhood feel anymore. Some of the staff is super friendly while others have attitudes. 

The coffee is impeccable and the food is delicious. That first sip of my soy hazelnut latte is always the most delicious and compares to no other coffee. This is what keeps me coming back. 

If you want to sit for a while, make sure you arrive at the right time. And keep in mind the right time is never the same time. You pretty much have to get lucky to find a good spot. I've started getting my coffee to go. Also, they don't open until 7AM. This is when my shift starts, so I can no longer go before work. A great remedy for this was to buy Lux beans and to brew my coffee in a French press each morning. I'm definitely not complaining about the quality. It's still delicious.

"I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant where I have treated so poorly by the wait staff. I'm actually rethinking my Green rating because I sincerely think this is my worst restaurant experience.

The one good thing I can write is that this place is really cute and it has an inviting patio. Lots of string lights and cute bistro tables. I really thought I was in for a great evening. Oh how wrong I was.

My friend and I walked in and the hostess immediately sat us at a four top right in front of the door. Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available, I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair. I pointed to a seat in the back and after trying to convince me I didn't want *that* table, the hostess led us to the back. It's not the worst thing that could ever happen and that instance did not ruin my evening, it was just weird.

We sat and were greeted by our waitress, who initially seemed very nice. We both ordered water to start and I asked her for a drink menu. Apparently the drink menu is on the back of the regular menu. It's just so small that I missed it the first time. She told me that Friday night is the $4 frozen house margarita night, so I went with her suggestion. By the time I finish pulling out my ID, my dining partner was ready to order. We got a queso appetizer, the vegetarian tacos with a side salad, and the machaca plate.

While we waited, a few more groups came in, were greeted, and received their adult beverages. It had been ten minutes since I ordered my drink, so I tried to look for our waitress. 

She finally popped up five minutes later, but avoided all eye contact with our table. When she did see me, she quickly ran outside. I understand she might have had a few tables outside, but why have an inside section to wait as well? The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled. (Margarita was still MIA at this point.)

Then, the queso came out, brought by two hipsters. It looked like an over-microwaved styrofoam plate in a skillet and tasted just as bad. My friend tried to make the best out of the situation, but I was ready to call the manager. I really, really regret that I did not. 

Nasty queso juice dripped all over the table and there was no silverware or napkins to be found. AND no wait persons or a hostess to ask for said items. (Twenty minutes after I ordered my margarita, it was still MIA.)

Our waitress finally popped up and asked how the appetizer was. My friend cut me off and said it was different, but okay. He took rare this opportunity to ask for silverware. The waitress made an excuse that it should have been on the table already and went to grab some.  When she came back, I asked about my drink.

With another lame excuse that could have been avoided if she ever check on us in the then-thirty minute absence, she finally brought me my drink. It was OKAY, not worth $4... more like $2-3. 

Two seconds later, the food came out. At least we had silverware?

1) My veggie tacos and side salad were okay. Is it bad that the BEST part of meal was the white, iceberg lettuce salad?
2) My friend's machaca was bone dry. Isn't machaca supposed to be tender, rehydrated, and edible? 

All in all, the salsa was the best part of the meal. Yet, one cannot enjoy a dining experience on salsa alone. This was sincerely my worst experience at a restaurant and I will not go back to Mucho Gusto.",low

It is really hard to find someone that does a great job on your hair the first time you see them. My stylist was Sara Groves and I am now a customer for life. I have the feeling she is going to have a very lucrative career doing hair, too bad her prices will triple in a few months. She sat me down and asked me all about my hair, my style, the products I use ect. The best part of the entire experience was that she really listened to me and cut my hair exactly how I asked. I wanted peek-a-boo highlights in my bangs, and even though she thought it was an odd choice (and asked me if I was sure a few times ;) she gave them to me.

I can tell the staff is used to dealing with the older gentleman types versus the hip and fun 30-something female SUV driving Mom types, but that's ok. The Mom-mobile was detailed just right, the wait wasn't too long, and the air freshener lasted more than 1/2 a day.

"If you're a fan of Postino, you have to make your way to Windsor pronto.

The central Phoenix restaurant and bar is owned by Postino owner Craig DeMarco (and it's right across the street from the central Phoenix Postino), and the atmosphere and vibe are similar to Postino's. Windsor also has an open dining room that extends to the patio, the lighting is also dim, and the servers are also hip.

There was a 30-minute wait for my party of two on a recent Friday night, and we sat in the indoor dining area, which overlooked the bar, which was bustling full of people and had standing room only. The restaurant is located in an historic brick building, and it has a cool wall covered completely in cassette tapes that makes it feel even hipper.

For food, my pal and I started with the Cheddar Fondue ($11) off the mostly-American menu, which comes with pretzels, apples, pork, bread and sausage. The pretzels were soft and chewy, and the portion was huge. I would have preferred just the pretzels, though the apples and cheese were an interesting combination. Definitely try that appetizer if you go-it was super-tasty.

For my meal, I got the Veggie Stack ($9), which was a pita topped with bean spread, quinoa, tomato, cucumber, avocado, radish,  corn and green goddess (I left the pickled beets off). I thought the toppings were interesting both taste- and texture-wise, and that part of the meal seemed relatively healthy. I paired it with some macaroni and cheese, which I enjoyed, though my pal and I weren't wowed. Maybe it's because the cheese wasn't plentiful or creamy enough, but it was still good. My pal had the Porkwich sandwich ($12). He said he liked it a lot.",low
What can I say I love AJs especially the Boulangerie or coffee bar.  Jason is the best.   The pineapple ice tea with a slice of pineapple is deli-sh with a yummy cheese croissant.  I admit I usually get something from the coffee bar and bistro more so than the actual grocery store.  Oh and if you go check out the display/decorations they are usually pretty cool.,high
"Well what can I say about this place?  The restaurant is located in an upscale commercial complex with boutiques and an AJ's in the middle of Arrowhead Ranch.  Definitely doesn't have the boring suburban feel which you get along Bell Road only a mile away.  The inside has exposed brick on the walls with sleek looking seating.  Each food item comes out looking like a self made creation from the chef.  I have to say the Marguerite pizza is one of my favorites.  Having a crispy crust and savory flavors that make my mouth want to eat more, more, and more.  But I don't need to eat more because I fill my mouth with a good wine.  I had  a Dutton Estate Chardonnay(I think) which was half off on this day which kept me happy.  This place did not fail me.
So will I be back?  Umm that's a yes!",high

I showed up about 40 minutes before closing and she didn't charge me the $2 but I donated $3 since they operate only on donations.  The table set with rocks and minerals was fun to check out.

Haha, what else needs to be said.

This place is a solid BBQ joint.  I'm from the southeast and I love pork BBQ.  I was raised on NC style (from southern VA) but I appreciate all BBQ's.  This place is pretty great.

It's inexpensive.  Decent customer service.  Cheap beer.  Very little fat/gristle in the pulled pork which is something I pay very close attention to.

"This was our second visit to Chelsea's Kitchen.  They have valet parking available, but there is lots of self parking in the same parking lot.  It's quicker just to self park.

We sat indoors both times.  When the weather is right, the outdoor patio is popular, but I prefer indoor seating.  It feels comfortable sitting inside.  The way the tables and booths are set up it feels comfortable, and not crowded.  The spacing is just right.  During peak times, there is a full bar inside to relax while you wait for a table.

We started with tuna tartare, guacamole and chips.  It was a good choice.  We also ordered some beer.  The beer choices were limited.  The table next to us had a pitcher of sangria ... that looked like the better choice.

For dinner we had the short rib tacos and the ahi tuna.  My son had the kids meal mac and cheese.  I've had the short rib tacos both times I've been here, and it's outstanding.  The braised meat is tender, and served with corn tortillas, beans, guac, tomatoes, etc.  All of our meals were good, but the short rib tacos were the best.

For dessert we shared the red velvet cake.  It comes with a small scoop of vanila ice cream.  It could have come with a little more ice cream.  The cake was moist and not too sweet.  It was gone in a minute.  

The bill for four including drinks and tip was $120.

On the way out, they have chocolate chip cookes with sea salt sprinkled on top.  A nice touch.  My son grabbed two cookies, and finished them on the drive back to the hotel.  Great dinner!",high
"I am a sucker for a theme restaurant. I have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick. When you arrive a nurse checks you in, gives you a hospital wrist band, and dresses you in a hospital gown. Seriously, I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food. The menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties, french fries fried in lard, shakes, pure sugar coke, and PBR. They have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways. We ordered 2 single bypass burgers (one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy,) all you can eat lard fries, a vanilla shake, full sugar coke and a PBR. The burgers were ordinary, the fries were ordinary, and the service (aside from being dressed as naughty nurses) was ordinary. The only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake. 

The bill came to around $30, which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. It is a gimmick. Heart attack, fat, lard, waitresses dressed as nurses, cook dressed as doctors, sugar, beer...whatever. It gets old pretty fast.",low
"Tried Shorty's today, sadly it will be my one and only visit. To begin service was mediocre at best, portions are small(I thought my steakburger was a slider), and there was also the black facial hair that was in between the cheese and burger. That's when customer service went down the drain, all we got was a ""that's weird"" and an I'm sorry. If your running a joint and a customer finds a big hair in their food you do whatever you can to save that customer and make them want to come back. Something, not just sorry for your luck. I will stick with RocketBurger, just up the street, cheaper, bigger portions, tasty and most important, they got great service.

"First of all, if you go here, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your bill when it comes!  honestly.  We went here 3 times.  all 3 times we were over charged....  either the menu's were out of date, or we were ""past happy hour time"" (BS)... oh and the other excuse... we just changed our menu.  blah blah blah  P

then they always have to ""get a manager"" to come to the table, which takes forever!  (I am sure they hope we leave)  PLUS! THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS!!!!  this is a definitely bait and switch!

1st time it happened we just dealt with it, and was like, whatever...

2nd time it happened, my daughter who just got back from deployment (Navy) wanted to do something special for us and took us all there.  My husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy CRAZY over what we thought as we were there for happy hour.  The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes, (gimme a break)  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of 'arguing about it.  We discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like, whatever...

3rd time...  took a friend there.  again we ordered devils ale.  on the menu it was listed at one price... when we got the bill, it was almost twice as much.  We waited for our server to come back, she never did, she totally ignored us.  I gave her a dollar tip (which is NOT like me, i tip very well, too well)  and I wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip.  

If you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to San Filepe's  that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun.  We much prefer there, we wll never go to Caddilac Ranch again.

"My daughter's 128i BMW was horribly keyed this summer and we found Harvil's through State Farm Insurance. Fred Harvil was very friendly and helpful to work with and we really appreciated his service. She dropped her car off on Monday I believe and she had the car back by Friday. His rates were very good and ended up being lower than we had expected, and what we liked about him is that he was very honest. My daughter had accidentally backed her car into a pole earlier that summer and hadn't gotten it fixed because she kept getting quoted around $500 and couldn't do that, but because Harvil was already going to fix the rest of the car he only charged her $100 to repair the back bumper which was really nice. He also set us up with a rental car for her through Hertz that she was able to leave there at the shop and have them pick up which was great and convenient. 

All in all, Fred Harvil was very pleasant to work with, timely, and left her car looking like new. Definitely recommend!",high

After managing a circuitous route to the top floor of a parking garage, we navigated a maze like structure of corridors to find the restaurant.

"I think chef Silvana Esparza first located the restaurant here on CALLE DIECISEIS (she renamed the street all by herself, apparently) to take advantage of cheap rent.  There was no way she was going to locate her Scottsdalish restaurant actually in Scottsdale.  So, people from the wealthier areas - and some First Friday urban hipsters whose parents foot their bills - make the trek down to CALLE DIECISEIS to partake in everything Barrio Cafe.  And they think it's cool that they are going there, past the check cashing places, the people waiting at the bus stops and the ""rawness"" of this part of central Phoenix.

And what is everything ""Barrio Cafe""????

Pretentious service.
LOUD dining room.
NO parking.
Fusion food that is about 10 years past its prime.
High prices.

Let's talk a little about the last item on the list.

Besides using vulgar language in her YouTube videos for pseudo social activism, Esparza seems to have forgotten her own humble upbringings.  It's ironic that the very people who live on and around CALLE DIECISEIS cannot afford to eat in her restaurant.  The Mexican immigrants and their sons and daughters who do the cooking, the cleaning, the landscaping and all that for Phoenix are not welcome at the Barrio Cafe.  I know that this is not a taco truck, but there is some overwhelming irony here that you locate your restaurant in a working class area and supposedly have sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden and the neighbors can't even eat  at your restaurant.  I guess that's capitalism.  Like that new car, by the way.",low
"I've now tried Thai Elephant three times.  My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful, but aside from one delicious dessert (black sticky rice with pumpkin custard), nothing stood out, either.  As a recent Bay Area transplant, I admit to being a bit picky, but in my 6 months in Phoenix, I've found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings (Swadee in Chandler, Thai Lahna in Arcadia, Sala Thai in North Phoenix, and, in a pinch, Thai Hut in Central Phoenix).  Until now, Thai Elephant hadn't really done it for me, but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences, I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance.

On Friday, looking forward to a relaxing night at home, I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken, Panang Curry with beef (extra spicy), and Spicy Eggplant with tofu (spicy, which I thought would be automatic given the name, but apparently wasn't).  I got home, meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees, and sat down to enjoy my feast.

Wow.  I don't know quite where to begin, but to say that I was disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.  The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store, only less flavorful; marginal at best, but edible.  The chicken didn't stand out as being of particularly low quality, but the noodles were some of the worst I've had at a Thai restaurant (some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy, while others were seriously soggy).

Sadly, the sub-par Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin.  The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy, overcooked vegetables and limp tofu.  The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced, and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure.  The Panang Curry with beef was even worse.  Though I ordered the dish ""spicy,"" the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in.  The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality, most gristly meat I've had at any restaurant I've ever been to.  I tried several pieces, and all were similarly inedible.

I really, really want to like Thai Elephant, but after the experience I had, I don't know if I can bring myself to give it another chance -- especially since I've found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the second-worst Thai meal I've had since moving here was at Thai Elephant's sister restaurant, Thai Basil in Ahwatukee.",low

The smell of home cooking lured me in, Great menu selections with sandwiches salads and hot dishes too, along with the daily specials which I think is one of each (sandwich , salad, hot meal).

Sandwiches come with fresh potato chips and a pickle spear,
I decided to try the Tuna since they don't put onions in it ,Hallelujah!(see pics)

You know what it was pretty tasty, I even ate all my chips and the pickle! My only complaint was the bread was a tad dry, but hey it happens.

"The 4 stars is in comparison to other Chipotle's I've been to, especially in this area.

I have to admit, when they were building this plaza, my friends and I tried to guess every day what it was going to be. We had it narrowed down to a Chipotle or a sushi joint (both would kill me for sure) and I cannot believe we were actually right. 

I am pretty pleased with this place. Both times I've stopped by it's been clean and pretty speedy service. Every time I come in, I am surprised by all the extra room around to the side and out on the patio and it makes me happy.

I'm sure anyone reading this has been to Chipotle, but if not, or if you're feeling like trying something new.. my signature dish for the past few years has been carnitas bowl with black beans, corn, fajita, lettuce and a little bit of the dairy stuff. Wash it down with a Nantucket nectar apple juice and you're golden.",high
"Damn good pizza! A little spendy (hence why I didnt give them 5 stars) for what you get but regardless, the pizza is pretty damn good. The wings are decent, I think there baked instead of fried and the sauce seems a little weak. They often have a 25 dollar special which includes 20 wings and a large pizza or some kind of 2 pizza wing combo for around 40 dollars. I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for some family fun times surrounded with fun people and good food.",high
"We had a fantastic experience here! We went on a Thursday evening and with the misters on, it was still very pleasant sitting outside, even in June. The wine list was extremely affordable - most between $25 and $60. For Scottsdale, this is a steal! We shared an appetizer and a main entree. The appetizer was delish. Grilled bread (perfectly grilled, not so hard that it hurts your gums) with three spreads - an amazing goat cheese and marscapone, eggplant, and hummus. Also, they serve house bread with a great sun dried tomato butter. For our entree, we shared the fish special, which was a sea bass with artichokes, fingerling potatoes, and spinach. Fantastic. The service was also great. 

I've come to expect any service in Scottsdale to be rude but  this place wasn't! Maybe we were lucky, but I enjoyed our experience.",high

"Here is my honest assessment of Los Reyes de la Torta.  It's a three-star place.  The atmosphere is a bit dumpy.  My apologies to those who think reviews should focus strictly on food, but atmosphere is what I notice when I walk in the door.  Plus, despite the fact that the place was mostly, we were led to the table closest to the restrooms.  Seriously?  

The star of the show here is obviously the tortas.  I tried the egg one, which had cheese and a very generous serving of sliced avocados.  This torta was delicious and a great value.  The other one I tried had chicken, onions, and some other stuff.  It reminded me of what they have at the Great Steak and Potato Company.  Not that that's a bad thing.  For the tortas I give 5 stars.  

Other stuff:

No alcohol.  'Nuff said.

Greasy potato chips as a side?  That was kind of a bummer.  I was craving tortilla chips or fries or anything a little more exciting than potato chips right out of the bag.

The flan was really dense and tasted like it was prepared forever ago in a huge vat.  Skip it.  You probably won't be hungry anyway after the tortas so don't get tempted by the pictures on the menu.",high

"Hate is such a strong word.. I try not to use when I its not really called for. When I set out to Yelp the Safeway across the street from me and the Mr.'s place I thought of using that word to describe how much I don't like this Safeway.  Of course it's warranted, they pissed me off!

Okay you know how they always do BOGOF on milk.. well me and the Mr don't drink that much milk so the cashier usually just gives me half off the 1 gallon. Well this time she forgot to and I didn't notice until I got home.. so seeing that I used to shop here once a week I figured Id just bring my receipt back the following week. Well the following week I went in and showed the receipt and the dumb bitch behind the counter was like, 'what am I supposed to do about it?'.. I explained to her what usually happens as the cashier gives it to me for half off.. she then proceeded to ask me which cashier was doing that, 'it's not our policy.'
After going back and forth for a few minutes I finally just told her to give me my 2 bucks.. she told me if I would have brought them the receipt back the same day they would have done something about it. Are you f-ing kidding me? Whats the difference besides my being inconvenienced having to drive back there. So I finally asked her if she was willing to lose a potential lifetime customer over 2 bucks? She responded, 'there's nothing I can do for you.' I then told her that her customer service skills suck and that I will NEVER return to the store. 

I guess never say never since I went into my very much disliked Safeway the other day. Believe it or not they make a pretty damn good sandwich and I despise Subway. So the 2 stars are for the yummy sandwich and the super cute guy who made it!

"I almost NEVER give a chain restaurant a 5-star review, not because I'm opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy. But Bandera is just that good, from the upscale casual, relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food.

Ordering the cornbread to start is a must - it'd be a crime not to. The grilled artichoke and queso/guacamole apps are also wonderful. I had the macho salad, which was quite large and packed with good stuff. I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good. Dessert offerings are limited to two choices, and neither blew me away, but the Oreo one was the better of the two.

Bandera is, like its sister restaurant Houstons, always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food.",high
"Funny story about my experience at this place. My Classmate mentioned she loves this place for other reasons than my own. Yet, when we drove up it was very crowded and parking is minimal when you don't arrive early. We drove in separate cars and I called and asked her, ""are you sure there is no where else we can hang out? It is super crowded. Yet, I am so glad she convinced me to go in and check it out. I suppose you ought to experience it at least once for a night out with friends. There were many different cultures/ethnic backgrounds. I very much enjoyed the band. They played some old school R&B from Next, Bobby Brown, Prince, Cameo and that's just some of what they performed. Excellent Band! The crowd was very pleasant and fun! I had to join in with dancing and singing. 

My rating review is 3.5 stars. I would have to say that this venue is way too small for the amount of people it holds, the dance floor is super small, it's really dark and hard to move around even when you are dancing. 

The staff at Char's is friendly and I've heard the service is good. I didn't drink. So just word of mouth. 

I'm not sure if I would hang out there again. I would probably go only if I knew a friend/friends were here. That would still be a maybe. Although, I enjoyed the music, etc. I'm on the fence about Char's for some of the minuses that takes away from a place that could be so GREAT!",high

"I saw the reviews of this Arribas and thought to myself, ""Are these people talking about the same Arribas I went to last night?"" I went there, and had an awesome time! Service was prompt, and if something was off, our server Jeff (who was amazing) explained why something happened, but didn't blame anyone, and didn't use server jargon. I do understand the jargon, but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it. 

Warm chips and salsas + warm bean dip came out = awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name. It burned, but I loved it. I ordered the Rio Grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba, and ordered it extra spicy. (Of course, I would) I was with my girl (and she likes strawberry margaritas) so we split the house margarita for 2, frozen with sugar of course. I'm not a huge margarita person, but it was really good. She ordered the cheese enchiladas. (She takes safe choices when we go eat) -more on the margaritas in a min- 

Food come out and seriously, it was some of the best spanish/mexican I've had in a while. Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food. It was fresh! Which is hard to find these days and I'm pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros. Which is cool. Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70's. I'm not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want. Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, what's that? Hatch chiles! I highly recommend them. I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles. It sets them apart. It brought the heat!

After dinner, I ordered another margarita...

This time, I asked Jeff of a recommendation. Why do I do this? Because the people that work at any restaurant know the food/drinks there more than you will ever know. 'Nuff said. He brought out some margarita I don't even know the name. It kicked my ass, thank god my girl was driving home, that's all I'm going to say. Thanks!

That's why this place gets 5 stars. It deserves it in my opinion.
I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general. I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process. I don't want food that's bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food. That makes for a BLAND place that's filled with, well, bland people. This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I don't know of. What a freaking great idea! Too hot for you? Then don't eat food that is 99% based on heat.

I will surely be going back, and I won't have a bad time.",high

"This Mexican restaurant has the best burritos in town!  This is not your roach infested 24 hour drive through kind of burrito joint either.  Here are the reasons that make La Tolteca #1 and one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix!
1-Full bakery with mouth watering fresh pastries
2-Fresh ingredients and great prices
3-Also serves beer if you feel like having a Corona with your meal as opposed to take out
4-Little market has the best prices in town on citrus fruits and just enough of everything to cook up a little Mexican meal (Ranch Market not needed!)
5-Make your own pico/ salsa bar, make it your style and get as much of it as you want:)
So, if you are downtown looking for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Of course it is super casual take out or seat yourself kind of place so don't  try to flatter your date here! But get there early, I'm pretty sure they close up shop by 9 or 10...",high

Your sales totally RAWK guys!  I mean, seriously - 50-70% off (gotta catch it just right, people) and then, an extra 30% off that?!  I feel like a wild thing, you make my heart sing.

OK, now today, the most I found was 40% off - B U T - then there's MAC!  Oooooooo, ya baby.  All that glitters is NOT gold.  (ok, it's the small things...)

"My friend took me for a birthday lunch.  John our waiter was very helpful and had perfect timing.  We shared the Stetson Chopped Salad and Fillet on Toast with leeks and homemade potato chips with blue cheese.  The kitchen plate/split our fillet, always a plus.  The salad with salmon, chicken is offered, was tossed tableside.  CC always has it's own twist on offerings.   The bread pudding and banana icecream were decadent.  
 Wish I lived closer.",high
"I've been taking mine and my family's cars to Cathedral for more than a decade. We are always treated fairly, and always have a good experience - the guys always stand by their work and ""go the extra mile"" to be sure our cars are fixed properly. They work on both our new(er) cars and my cars from the 50s and 60s. 

Whenever anyone is looking for a mechanic, I will send them here without fail - and John and the guys at Cathedral have always come through by totally taking care of anyone I send to them. In a business filled with some sketchy practices, I know that whether I send my wife, a friend, or a coworker to Cathedral they will be treated honestly and fairly. Cars break and break down, that's a fact of owning one. I'm glad I have Cathedral to make dealing with it so easy and stress free so I can get back on the road as quickly and cheaply as possible.",high
"Imagine a white silk wedding dress.... black! Well, that may be a bit dramatic but it was pretty bad. More than 1.5 years after my wedding I took my dress in to Bell. They kept my dress for a couple weeks, called me when it was ready and I was so excited to see it almost new. They did a fantastic job and were careful not to over treat the lace and silk with chemicals. They made me feel like they really cared. 

The business is family owned and the man at the front is so nice to work with. And, the pricing was extremely fair. I paid $89 which was much more reasonable than other places I checked. 

I highly recommend Bell Cleaners.",high
"This review is mainly for the bar and a few light (ok not light, but small) snacks.  

Met with a couple people during their soft opening and there was absolutely nothing soft about it.  I got there a few minutes early and posted up at the bar to grab a Manhattan.  This drink is usually my boozometer when I am trying a place first.  Ok, we've got something here, this drink is tasty.  Started talking to the bartenders and got a really comfortable feeling from them.  When was the last time that you sit down to the bar and  they ask your name, tell you their's, and then shake your hand?  

After the manhattan the rest of the group showed.  The bar was a little too busy to fit the three of us so I took my second drink, sazerac, to the table.  Sazerac was tasty as well.  Rest of the table ordered some drinks and nothing negative to be said anywhere.  We each had around 4 or 5 drinks and every last one of them was delicious.  

We were comped a few bar snack and all were delicious but the stand out was the warm nuts. (twss)  Mixed nuts warmed with Herbs De Provence and a little bit of chili flake I believe.  Soooooo good.  

As for the style of the place it is fantastic.  Feels cool but not cliche.  The Palomar staff did a fantastic job of designing this space.  As of now this is the one place in City Scape that is worth while.",high
"I see a few of the previous reviews discussing issues with service, but I have always had good service at this place.  I have only been in a handful of times, but we never have to wait very long to be helped, and the staff is very friendly.
I have only ordered salads there, but I've enjoyed the three that I've tried (Maggie's, Jamaican Jerk Chicken, and Greek).  The salad dressing always comes on the side, which is perfect, because that is how I like to order salads (so I can control the amount of dressing.)  My husband loves the pulled pork, although it's popular and sells out pretty quickly from our experience.",high
"We had the potstickers, kobe beef skewers, red curry clay pot and sizzling shrimp. All of the items were mediocre at best. The potstickers were deep-fried and way overdone. The beef was also overcooked and somewhat flavorless. The curry was very spicy but otherwise strangely bland. Steamed rice was extra and came in a cup sized bowl. If I had been told that the shrimp dish was store-bought and microwaved, I would not have argued with that.
Service was normal. Music was annoying club tunes and too loud for 6pm. 
All in all, I'm glad we had a groupon and didn't have to pay full price for a decidedly below average dining experience.",high
"Teresa S. and I were one of the lucky ones to win tickets to see Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci last night at the Symphony Hall, and we were impressed with the acoustics. The overall sound quality of the live act was fantastic, so overall I'd say that the gig was pretty amazing.

It's a fabulous hub of culture, but the food concessions need some urgent attention. The only munchies they have are desserts like cookies or pies, so be sure to have dinner first.

One of the great things they offer is you can now pre-reserve your intermission drinks.

You can pre-order your favorite libation before the show, and they will have them ready on the refreshment table. 
That would save you time in case you need to whiz to the loo, and not have to wait in line again to buy your drinks.

Thank you again to Yelp and Arizona Opera. The show was wonderful.",high
"I love to eat here, however it is hit or miss. Sometimes we get good service and other times we don't. Sometimes the food is really good, but other times it's off. Our order is usually messed up, but they are good about fixing it. One thing I have a problem with is using coupons here, I had a coupon for a pizza and also ordered an appetizer at happy hour half off. They did not want to combine the two offers but the coupon didn't say say anything about that. 
When the food is good though it's really good, which is why we return.",high
"Great place! I've been coming here for quite some time now and every time I received excellent customer service. The servers are always friendly and attentive.

I LOVE the sushi there. They have a lot of fun, new rolls that are unique to Bamboo Grille. The spicy sauce they put on the rolls gives them a great kick too.

Recently I've noticed that the place has looked a little unfinished with random stuff here and there. Baffled, I asked a server and was informed that they are in the process of remodeling. Needless to say I'm excited for the newly designed Bamboo Grille!",high
"Ate here again this weekend and I am happy to say that Fudd's has officially won me back.  The burger was positively delicious!!!!

I hate weird seasonings or funky toppings on my fries (see review for Greek Gyro Express... and try to keep your cookies down).",high
"I'm a value sorta guy...considering that, I should HATE this place on paper, but the quality, selection of items you won't find other places, and general vibe of the store are fantastic.

"Third visit was lower than second, which was lower than first.  Excellent service, but declining food quality.  Bacon was chewy, eggs ordered ""over hard"" were nearly raw in the middle.

I might try them one more time, but probably will move on to better places.",high

"The new store is smaller than the previous one. But it's still a reliable digging source for records. I wish there was a better selection of dance tracks, but that isn't really their thing. They did have the new Chromatics and Glass Candy 12"" singles when I was in there last, which was nice.

Great selection of hip hop vinyl, some awesome indie records, etc. Definitely recommend this if you're in the Tempe area.",high
"As the prior reviewer states I too drove by this place a million times. My husband and I love breakfast and are always seeking the ultimate omelet . We both ordered (of course) an omelet. Mine was chorizo, cheese and green chilies and my husband's was cheese and mushroom. I must say the food was piping hot, which is always a plus for me, I like my food hot! The omelet was pretty darn good, and the hashbrowns were nice and crisp. Not my ultimate omelet but I would definitely go again.",high
"YC's is a pretty cool place to go.  Here's how it works: you get a bowl and you fill it up with anything you want, including sprouts, broccoli, carrots, onions, peppers, scary dehydrated meat and much more.  

After all your ingredients are in your bowl, you then get to choose the sauces you want to put in it.  They have suggestions and recipes for you to follow, from sweet to super spicy. Or you can always make up your own. 

Then the chef's wok it up for you and pour it all back into your bowl.  You can add some rice to it, sesame seeds or any other toppings that you want and choose a table to sit at. 

My only warning is to vegetarians- you must ask the cook to clean off the grill before cooking yours because if you don't, you will get little pieces of meat in your bowl that have been left on the grill from someone else's meal!",high
"Velvet wallpaper adorn the dimly lit  walls here, and make you feel like Dean Martin might sit at the table next to you. Old school, in the classic sense. I used to work across the street from here, and would stop in from time to time for a great happy hour, occasional employee lunch for my staff or a special occasion dinner from time to time. Being from New England, it says a lot when I admit that they have the best Oysters Rockefeller I have ever had. Ever. The steaks are just wonderful, and the martinis perfectly poured. But you know what secret thing I ADORE about this place (besides the back entrance through the kitchen)? The bread. Warm white rolls smothered in a garlicky-leek chutney of some sort. For all those times your Mom told you not to fill up on bread, just disregard. She never had this bread. While I think you should always splurge here for a fantastic dinner, the real bargains are lunch and Happy Hour.",high
"So this is my current Sunday All day Happy Hour JAM!

This place is SO GOOD and I'm not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts.

The Chefs Pizza of the day hasn't let me down yet... We don't even ask we just order it!  The Chefs Board is pretty good too! My fav dish right now is the Broccolini - super simple but it's just so light / fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini & Meatballs if your their for happy hour. 

Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff. The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case. 

The parking / Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says ""Complimentary"" not Mandatory - park your car yourself if you want.",high
"Used to live in this neighborhood, and it was a favorite.  
The place is clean and modern, I love the look of the bar.  The servers are very good, and friendly.  
Used to go with a group of friends for ""taco tuesday"" almost every week.  They have now taken this off the menu, but will still do it for you if you ask, which is cool.  (two fish/steak/or chicken tacos and a margarita or beer for $10).
So why only the three stars?  The last two times I have been there, food has not been good at all.  Had the ahi tuna sandwich which was always my favorite.  It's served rare with this wasabi mayo and so so good.  However, second to last trip there, ordered it and the tuna was not good quality.  It was stringy and didn't smell right.  Took two bites and that was it.  Because I'd had so many good experiences gave it another try, convinced myself it was a one time bad piece of tuna and ordered it again.  Big mistake.  Stringy and inedible again.  Probably won't be going back.  And if I do, I have learned my lesson about the tuna.",high
"Fresh & Easy is the US subsidiary of UK based grocer Tesco who entered the American market in 2007.  I know Tesco really well and they are smart business folks who know their market.  Fresh & Easy has been opening stores all over the Phoenix area and have been using $20 and $10 coupons to build market share.  I give them a lot of credit for doing this.

I also have been shopping here for a long time and appreciate their eye on packaging food items for the busy consumer.  One of my favorites is their rosemary focaccia bread dough.  I've made it at home, but Fresh & Easy make it ohhh so easy when I'm tired and it's 6:45.

"Even though I've only been to Bosa once I've had the donuts from here several times.  My parents have been coming here regularly (like, multiple times a week regularly) since this place opened and every time I come to visit they make sure to get me donut in the morning when they know I'm hungover in bed.

Now, I'm only reviewing this place for the donuts.  I didn't even know this place served other breakfasty stuff until I came here myself, but the other pastries & coffee drinks sound good as well.  That being said, when it comes to donuts Bosa is as good as it gets.

They're soft, chewy, and all around yummy...that goes for all varieties (well, the ones I've tasted anyway).  Another good thing...they're CHEAP!  It's not like donuts break the bank anyway, but even compared to chain donut places the donuts here practically cost nothing.  

The place itself is not much to look at, but who cares!  All I want is the donuts!",high
"I've eaten here last year and this is the second year. I finally am able to compare steaks to another location. I love the decoration as it's sports of all kinds. There's always something new you haven't seen before. It's the perfect place to eat and study what is around you.

I had the crusted Parmesan cheese steak. I had tomato bisque and the string onions. Those are good! I had the steak and it felt like it was missing something. I'm not sure what as I don't eat steak a lot. 

The soup was great. It was a cup and perfect. The onion strings were good. The steak was ok. I'll always go back, but not for steak. I also wish their menu was more broad with more items to choose from.",high
"Old Chicago is about what you'd expect  from a chain serving by that name - a pretty basic menu, with a Chicago slant.  The food rates a solid 3 stars - not outstanding, but certainly not bad, and good enough for me to go back.  I threw in a 4th star because we've had consistently great service there.  We've had one waitress twice who is genuinely nice, clearly doesn't hate her job, and is on top of her game service-wise.  That stuff goes a LONG ways with Brak.  For a casual meal and perhaps a couple of belts, I rank Old Chicago comfortably ahead of such yawners as TGI Fridays (which has declined a TON in recent years IMHO) and others like Chilis and (gasp) Applebee's.  Give it a try, I think you'll like it.",high
"Surprised this place isn't closed by now. Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came back.

Their ingredients are not fresh, gyro meat tastes old and decrepit. They really need to hire better pita makers who don't resemble drug addicts and derelicts. My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me. Literally, by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating!",low
"I will never know what the food tastes like because they were so so rude, I will not go back.  We came in and were given a table, menus were practically thrown at us.  And then we waited, and waited and waited.  We asked a woman working there, and she apparently did not speak English and indicated a man at the front would help us.  But he was too busy talking.  We got up and left.  No one even said a word when we left.",low
"I went here a few months ago, well I guess when they first opened, whenever that was (the fall of 2010 maybe). Anyways I am a vegan so asked about their vegan options. They said that pretty much everything was made with lard (I didnt know that people really still used that) but they said that they had a vegan burrito. I was assured that there wasnt any kind of un-vegan ingredients (such as cheese) in it. I ordered the vegan burrito with much skepticism. Once I got home and got about half way through the burrito I got a big mouth full of CHEESE!! 

I was so upset because I was assured that it was vegan and did not come with cheese. But even worse,  I think that they started putting cheese on the burrito and then realized that it was supposed to be the vegan burrito with no cheese and they just kind of picked what cheese they could off and left the cheese that they couldnt easily pick off on there. I am not positive thats what happened but im pretty sure.

Anyways aside from the fact that they REALLY messed up my order, the burrito was just okay. It was really pretty greasy. My fiance on the other hand seems to enjoy this place, he gave it 4 stars. He said that it is a good place for greasy mexican, and on Wednesdays you can get a huge burrito for only 5 dollars.",high

"The boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday morning hung over from Four Lokos. 

The food was fucking great and I don't even like breakfast food.  I got this egg and jalapeno burrito thing with this sort of runny but generally pretty tasty salsa and I wanted to shower in the burrito filling.  I would have bathed in eggs and salsa if only to prolong my experience with this semi-breakfast burrito thing.  I would have married it and had kids with it and bought a house in Michigan nearby a really good school district.  I fell in love with the egg jalapeno burrito thing, I would cuddle with it on weekday mornings and plan trips to national parks with it.  

It was also nice sitting on the patio considering the weather is so pretty and the staff was attentive and friendly and slightly charming with their loafers and novelty socks (is that part of the required uniform I wonder?)

I'm deducting one star for the sheer fact that this place was filled with rich, middle aged white yuppies talking about golfing and/or glued to their cell phone.  The boyfriend and I, being young dirty Mesa kids still slightly intoxicated off Four Lokos, felt mildly out of place in this setting and were a little over whelmed by the amount of yuppie whiteness.

Nonetheless, the food was worth the trip and the cozy patio on a Sunday morning was a nice change from, you know, Cheerios on the futon while watching exercise equipment infomercials.",high
"A couple Saturdays ago, went with my mom to get my name added to her accounts should the unthinkable happen. We first went to Chase which took all of ten minutes. The personal banker was great - in-out-done.  Then we headed to her Credit Union at approximately 10:00 AM. They were quite busy, apparently. When we checked in, I heard grumbling from other customers and asked the wait time.  I was told there were two people ahead of us in line and it ""shouldn't be long.""

30 minutes later, my mom went to ask how much longer it would take. Jennfer, who was manning the reception desk, dismissed her rudely in front of a lobby of customers. My mom is as sweet as tea in Tennesee, so to hear her called out in front of a lobby of people as a disruption was upsetting.  45 minutes later, I went up to ask if it would be much longer. Jennifer said curtly, ""We're busy."" Apparently, on Saturdays, they're busy and one should avoid transacting business there on the weekend. I don't recall being spoken to so rudely at even a fast food restaurant in recent years...

Another ten minutes or so went by (as did my deadline to make another appointment I had made), I was told it would be ""two more minutes"", as I had to go through their background check to be a member. They were having a difficult time with my Washington Driver License and the weird characters it has (an asterisk in part of the number). After all was said and done, over an hour later, I was approved to be a member and was successfully put as a signer on my mom's account.

I asked for Jennifer's card, as I told her I was not happy with the way she had spoken to me or my mother, and I intended to speak with her manager.  To that I received a reply she did not have one. The woman sitting next to her informed me she was the assistant manager and that they were busy on Saturdays. My biggest beef was this: If it was going to be an hour to speak with someone, tell me. I can make other arrangements or come in during the week. Being told first, ""It shouldn't be long,"" and then, ""We're busy"" is not an excuse. If the business is so overwhelming on Saturdays, perhaps it would be wise to staff more people, extend the hours, or inform people of the wait they're likely to experience because of the queue. Or don't open on Saturdays!

As a 20 year veteran of the service industry, I am very disappointed at the level of service Arizona Federal Credit Union provided my mom and me, but also all the other people I watched be dismissed like the Credit Union was doing them a favor. After doing some searching for a new home for mom's money, she can get a much better rate at a (four letter word forthcoming) BANK!

I'm normally a big fan of member-owned institutions, but based on the incredibly rude serviced I received from Arizona Federal Credit Union, I'd say go to a Credit Union or Bank where the employees actually read the mission statement that is painted on the wall behind them.",low
"The food was absolutely delicious.  Was very surprised in finding a good Asian restaurant here in Phoenix.  We had the papaya salad with soft shell crab, Phnom Penh noodle soup, and the lehong noodles.  All were delicious and very SE Asian.  I could not believe how great the food was.  But the best part was the grass jelly drink - it brought me back to my childhood.  Can't wait to try the other dishes here.  A definite must try here in Phoenix.",high

"This place used to be quite good but I think they may have had an ownership change recently.  Over the past 12 months or so we have seen the quality of the food and service level both drop to unacceptable levels.

The food is overall average - the fajitas down right poor and the drinks very inconsistent.  They do get somewhat busy with a bar crowd but that too seems inconsistent so when they do get busy the service gets very bad.

When service deteriorates the Manager (or owner, I'm not sure) seems to hide from customers. 

Overall, make the trip down to Shea Blvd and find much better at better prices.",high
"A group of friends and I decided to check out Vincent's Saturday Market this past weekend after a beautiful morning hike had worked up our appetites.  When we got there, the place was packed (but still had space to accomodate our group of 6).  It was the perfect outdoor market feel, with fresh vegetables from the garden available for purchase, next to organic lotions and soaps, and all sorts of food stands to whet any appetite (crepes, tacos, paninis, etc).  There was even a mimosa stand, where for $20 you could purchase a bottle of champagne, a glass of OJ, and as many plastic cups as needed.  This is definitely going to be added to my list of favorite places to enjoy a beverage while observing some extremely entertaining people watching!  I loved it, and hope to go again soon!",high
"I've been here three times once for lunch and twice for dinner. Lunch was pretty crowded, dinner not so much but tons of take out. Prices are cheap and food is good!

"Eh.... 2.5 stars, maybe? 3? Not sure, yet.

After looking at the menu online, I really wanted to like this place. The menu has some creativity to it, unlike the template-North-Indian-restaurant-menus you find at many of the Indian restaurants in the Valley. Aside from offering things like korma, kadai, vindaloo, etc. with a variety of options (chicken, lamb, paneer, shrimp or fish for each) they also have some other more unusual choices, like one of my favorite dishes, mattar malai methi (creamy fenugreek and peas). And dahi vada in the appetizers... I couldn't wait to check it out.
Unfortunately, three friends and I went at lunchtime on a Saturday - and there was a buffet. So I didn't get to try any of those tempting dishes.

The restaurant itself, while  decorated a little haphazardly (Chinese paintings?) is bright and clean. There's a TV on a wall, which happened to be playing one of my favorite Bollywood movies...so I was still excited about the place.

But...after tasting the food...meh.

The buffet was all right.. but nothing to write home about. Pluses? Once again, it had something different..fish curry as well as an Indian-style Chinese dish or two. So that was cool. But the food was just so-so. I was there fwith three other people - one of them said the cuts of meat, especially the chicken, were of higher quality than most Indian buffets. But he didn't like the sauces so much. One other friend said he liked the tikka masala, but that was about it.
As for the vegetarians, well, we didn't have a lot of choices. Veggie manchurian (which was pretty good), a very bland chana masala and some pea/carrot thing that reminded me more of baby food than anything else.
The dessert was just all right, too. And the rice was very bland.

So, overall, I wasn't impressed. But I don't want to judge the place too harshly based just on the buffet. After all, Curry House was packed on a Saturday afternoon, so I'm thinking maybe it's got something better to offer me.. I'll have to go back for dinner and see what their non-buffet selections taste like before I totally write this place off my list.",high
"Just down Scottsdale Rd from the plastic, the cougars, the roid rage, and the Delta Bravos is a little place that doesn't give a shit, in the best possible way. 

In many ways, this is the dive bar Scottsdale doesn't deserve but needs oh so badly (and let's face it, being south of McDowell probably means you are not in Scottsdale by many people's account, which is just fine). 

To be clear, let's discuss some things a dive bar is...First, they serve drinks and beer. No basil martinis, No Sonoma pinot noir, and No craft double IPAs. Second, you do not come here to be seen or for a scene...see the first point for what you come here for. Third, the motif...none...unless you count a few characters at the bar. 

Now those are the basics, but Rogue Bar adds in great local and national acts, a diverse, non-Old Town crowd, and a friendly staff. 

For instance, I recently saw The Mulhollands, from LA, and I assure you, this band will soon be playing venues where you won't be getting up on stage with the band...not that anyone I know did such things. 

That is a great thing about RB, the lack of pretense carries throughout all aspects...even the DJ let me play with his DJ toys. 

Yes, yes, you don't want to model your toilet after theirs, the pool table is old, and you may see a fight. But, these are added flavor for a true dive bar. 

At the end of night you can say you had the chance to -- crash in some comfy booths, play some pool, order pizza for the bar, meet some real people, have a cheap drink, and if you are lucky, hang out with the band at an after party. 

If you like a dive bar, go. If you don't, stay up the road, nobody will miss you at Rogue.",high
Hate long lines at the DMV?  Hate dealing with the DMV for any reason? Then you should check out Desert Title Service.  I had a complicated Title transfer and was dreading spending 4 hours at the DMV office the last day of the month but I knew I had to do it.  So today my daughter and I went over to DMV and waited an hour before deciding to call Desert Title Service.  Had I known I could go in to a place with no lines get a title release and a title transfer I would have checked them out sooner.  I called their office while sitting in the DMV and drove over.  In less then 15 minutes I had the title released and the title transferred.  Daughter had new plates and her title in less then 5.  If you need anything to do with your car I urge you to call them and/or visit their office.  You will be surprised at how fast and efficient their office is.

Sometimes you can find good deals on the kitchen appliances as well, like the blenders for my protein shakes.

Don't order the pancakes, they are not very good. The chicken strips were a-ok.",low
"I haven't had this in a while so I can't really give a ton of detail but I have been here a few times. It's a traditional japanese restaurant and from what I remember the food was decently priced maybe a little more expensive for dinner than other places. The thing I remember about this place that I really liked were the lunch bento boxes. They had a ton of food and miso soup and all that and they were a great deal, I don't know how much they were but it was very cheap for what you get. The service is only average but for a cheap lunch with more traditional sushi I would definitely hit this place up.",low
"Satisfied my sweet and savory liking in a single swath.  Just had my first visit here and will be back soon.  The crepes were tasty and light, the service was attentive and friendly.  Too bad they aren't open later for a sociable evening with dessert and caffeine.",low
"I've been here many many times and have never had a bad time. Everything has always been up to par. I literally have no complaints.

AND - I recently dropped a personal check made out to me while getting cash out to pay my bill. The manager found it and mailed it back to my client. Talk about honest service. 

BJ's is our go to place for an easy weekend lunch. Their home brewed root beer is super good.",low
"I've been to Orange Table a few times and adore the venue, grocery and store. However, I have been less than impressed with the food. The first time I went for breakfast and had the Jersey Girl Omelet. It was good but not great. The next timeI had the mushroom pizza. It was so greasy that I had to go through multiple napkins and could only eat 1-2 small pieces before I gave it all to my friends.

To sum it up, if you are looking for a chill place to hang out, people watch and do some small gift shopping it is a great place but don't do there for the food.",high
"I have now played Longbow three times (twice in 2009, and once in 2010).  I do have to say it's a fine course for all tastes.

I can't say it's a 5 star course, because it doesn't have quite the scenery and/or elevation changes that some that are nearer to the mountains have.  But it has enough interesting holes to make it a unique experience.

It's not a gimmicky course by any means.  The course is more or less flat, with enough mounding on the fairways and around the greens to make it challenging.  One major advantage this course has is that there are not any houses on the course.  This means you don't have to worry about breaking anything if you like to slice the ball; the worst that can happen is that you lose your ball in the desert.

I also really like the fast greens.  These greens are among the fastest and the truest I've played, and it's really a delight to putt on them.

This is a great course for a cheap afternoon round during the summer.  For $40, you are probably better off going a few miles down the road to Las Sendas, but sometimes in the afternoon rates can be had for under $30.",high
"This place is the best! They stopped doing tacos, but if your lucky! they do have them call before you go! Some outside seating (picnic tables) no seating inside.

I came here today for a manicure and pedicure... I have been here quite a few times; it is a place my girlfriends like to come to so when I want to hang with my girlfriends and get a mani/pedi this is where we meet.  Although today I was solo:(.  The ladies here do a really good job; my manicures always last a really long time and they are really nice and accommodating.  Today I had one girl doing my pedicure and another doing my manicure... now that is what I call service!  I was out of there in a hour.  They do not have a tip line on credit or debit so bring cash for the tip.  Today I did not have cash ( i forgot)  they were so nice they said next time I come I can tip then if I want.  I came back anyway to tip them because it was so fast and my nails look great.  Oh another thing I forgot to mention is they use the hot rocks for the massage part for both the manicure and the pedicure and the callous remover is part of the cost of the pedicure.  Total for both services including getting french manicure on toes and fingers was $42.00.,high
Their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service.  If I want low prices I will go to goodwill over this place.  Looks like Dillard's is on my list of do not shop.,low
"If you just need a roof over your head I suppose this will do. Don't expect things to be easy for you though. I arrived on Friday shortly before 2pm and wanted to check in early. The pregnant woman at the desk (the one that smells like cigarettes and has track-marks up and down her arms) said the room wasn't ready yet, so I left and drove around to take in the sites.

Coming back an hour later (now officially check-in time), I was told that that room STILL wasn't ready. How long does it take to clean a room? You've got 100 other rooms, put me in one of those! She left me standing at the desk while she went out and found a room that was ready. Finally.

This is the first place I've ever stayed that wasn't a converted B&B that had hardwood floors. Hardwood floors are cute when you're staying in somebody's house-turned-hotel, but in an actual motel? I felt like I was staying in a hospital room.

Sparse furnishings include: 12"" TV, 2 hand towels, 1 wash cloth, 1 towel, huge desk that takes up more space than it should, and a scratchy bed. 

Like I said, it's an okay place if you just need a place to sleep.",low
"I am new to the Phoenix area and was in the mood for someone else to cook my breakfast for a change and stumbled across all these rave reviews of Matt's on yelp. Normally I find that the yelp reviews are just about spot on and very honest. This is my first case of the contrary. I don't know what hole in the wall ""amazing"" breakfast joint these reviews were for, but I must have been at the wrong place.........

Don't get me wrong this place is reasonably priced for your basic breakfast, but that is about it. I gave them an extra star for using ""local"" ingredients. This place is below Waffle House and the like on my list. 

The hash browns were more like a chopped potato omelet that needed a few more minuets, I.E. raw mashed potato in the middle. They take ""over easy"" a little too serious also. If there were such a thing as egg tar tar, that's what was on my plate. If you have ever had eggs like this, the ones that can't even be eaten with a fork, then you know my pain. I will say my pork chop was good, but who can screw up a pork chop? The bread was good, nice thick cut slices of what looked to be locally baked loafs. The preserve that came with said toast was okay too, but it got snatched away before I could finish. 

All in all, this place is good for the sheep that need to eat downtown, but lacks anything for a reason to return or recommend it to anyone. If you are in the area and thinking of eating here, try somewhere else. I didn't have to wait in line like many on yelp have stated, and I'm sure glad I didn't for that lack of quality. There are many other options in the area, give someone else a shot that's not banking on you eating there because they were on T.V.................",low
"We finally went back to Merc Bar last Saturday night and as I suspected would happen, I liked the place a lot better when it was dark outside! My husband and I took my sister (who was in town for the weekend) to meet a few friends before dinner at Lola Tapas (review to come in a few minutes). 

We were the first people in the bar, which was a little awkward at first but kind of nice, since we had a fancy, chic space all to ourselves! We all enjoyed our drinks, including my husband's and my dirty martinis. My only gripe was that they didn't come with the blue cheese olives mentioned on the menu already in them. Instead, the server brought them to our table and then asked if we wanted the olives. 

I still don't think I'd linger at Merc Bar for hours (unless I was drinking Red Bull drinks to stay awake!) because I find the vibe just a bit too underground for my tastes, but I will definitely be back for a pre or post dinner drink.",high
"Dear Arizona Cardinals, 
Can you please get your crap together and win some games (similar to last night) so Phoenicians will like you and you can finally build a fan base?  

While I half-enjoyed watching you spank the St. Louis Rams yesterday in the last game of the season, while scoring the most points in a Cardinals game since the 1970s, you still suffer from mediocrity.  Your win against the lowly Rams was hardly inspiring since that team completely sucks. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, can you please beat the piece-of-crap 49ers?!?!

You remind me of a nouveau riche socialite with no manners.  You have a beautiful expensive abode, but still seem like you're from the wrong side of the tracks.  Please tell your owners to stop being so cheap, beef up your roster, spend a little dough and take some risks and the ever-elusive glory years might be around the corner.

Last night, a jaded and cynical fan of yours told my friends (in Rams jerseys) in the parking lot, ""Thanks for sucking today.  WE usually suck and all, but your team was much worse.""

Funny and defeatist attitude, but what do you expect?  I'll be here waiting, cheering and hoping.  There's always next season. 

Five stars for trying.
One star for the crappy ownership.",high

The decor is as previously described - you sort of time warp back to the 80's but it is clean and well loved by its owner.  They do have a lot of authentic menu items and a great kids meal, but the ramen was just not that good.  Its downfall was the broth.  Hubby got the salmon chirashi which was also not that fresh.  If I'm in the area, I may give it another try for the don-buris.",high

the joint is hoppin, but they still manage to get you out in about 10 minutes.  plus, you get to stare at frank sinatra while you wait (young, cute blue eyes, not the older, less attractive version) and listen to the tv blaring.  and if you are me, the QUEEN of movie trivia, you enjoy your wait as a time to school co-workers in ""the Game"" while you wait for your AWESOME slices.

I've tried six dishes here every one has been excellent.

"Yummy pancakes made from special house batter were perfectly golden, light/airy & spongy in texture, and had a subtle maple flavor even without the addition of their syrup.  Pancakes are their flagship breakfast entree, though you can choose from the many other items including omelettes, french toast, or the common 2-egg with sides combos.

This place has a local owner with a family member as the chef named Dean that is admired by most patrons.  Oh, and he's the one who makes the delicious pancakes of course.  Atmosphere is clean, sterile, and almost like an old hospital cafeteria from decades ago (notice the operating room blue colored booths).  

Patrons are almost exclusively senior citizens and the feel is relaxed, comfortable, and really is a throwback to casual breakfast spots were in the past.  Location is on the north side of Peoria just before 99th ave., not far west of the 101.  It's an older strip mall with ample parking, but down't be thrown off by the modest exterior (restaurant is to the far right when you enter the lot).

I really like this place because of the overall vibe, friendly service, and pancakes.  It's also a nice getaway from Millennials.",high
"I've never been done wrong at Chelsea's. But I've never been utterly wowed either. The food is consistently good, the service and atmosphere are top notch and it's in a great location, but I can't seem to give them five stars.  I have always gotten their tacos and most recently tried the seared ahi ones that our server said were only on the lunch menu but I could get for dinner. The ahi was perfectly done and tasted great but didn't really jive with the soft taco fixins. Still it was tasty and I ate and liked it. JD had a cheeseburger that he described as ""meh, not as good as Delux (his gold standard)"". 

Maybe my only thing against  Chelsea's is that it has yet to serve me anything so special to make me YEARN to go back again. If someone suggests it for dinner I'm all in, but would I ever be the suggestee? Nope probably not. Perhaps I should try something new the next time I go and I just might fall for Chelsea's a little harder, but for now she's just an acquaintance that I don't talk bad about but neither do I praise.",high
"Having gone to the now-closed location on Shea, I didn't expect to find myself at the new The Herb Box anytime soon.  My one visit was fine, but didn't leave me wanting more.  However, when Deb L hosted a recent UYE, it was the perfect opportunity for great company at the very least.  Well I'm happy to report I received even more than great company....great food, great service, and comfortable, yet beautiful surroundings were also on the plate.  

I began the evening with a glass of their house-made sangria.  I could drink this light and fruity beverage all day.  In fact, I think it would make a fine substitute for my morning OJ.  I did have a hard time choosing an entree.  While I was tempted by the pear and gorgonzola flatbread, I chose the goat-cheese chicken instead.  The shoulder cut chicken was perfectly cooked, but the meat itself was perhaps a little bland, although admittedly I do prefer chicken to be well-seasoned.  The goat cheese stuffing and the fig jam, however, resulted in an overall quite tasty dish.  I loved the mushroom risotto cakes served alongside!!

The Herb Box also graciously offered our table a variety of sweet treats at the end of the meal...a slice of fig bundt cake (my favorite), a couple different cupcakes, a whoopie pie, and a passionfruit cake.  While all were enjoyed, none of these wowed me.  I do think these may have been pastries available at the market, and not their dessert menu items.   

So thanks to Deb for giving me a reason to try The Herb Box.  I'm sure I will be back again!  I didn't get a chance to browse the market!",high
"Food was good but I can't say I was terribly impressed overall.  The food kind of took a ridiculously long time even when only one other table was in the restaurant.  The appetizers came out fifteen minutes after our main meals - we had figured they forgot about it.

Tastewise, things were decent but not quite memorable.  I had a chicken shawarma and the whole ordeal was filling but a bit on the bland side.",high
"WOWSA- we just moved here from NYC and this pizza is like home :)  We tried the Brooklyn and Da Works  pies and the Brooklyn was WAY BETTER. I didn't like the Da Works (don't care for fresh tomatoes on top of my pizza).

"I was quite pleased when I visited Quick N Clean today. I opted for the $6 wash-- though now I can't quite remember what was included in said wash. I felt like it could have been a little bit more thorough in the rinse/dry section, as there was a trail of dirt coming off the back of my car.

HOWEVER-- be not dissuaded by the dirt on my bumper (as I wiped it off, and the rest of the car looked great) because the vacuums at this place? OH MY GOSH! I have never been to this kind of car wash and experienced such suction. They were also an ideal shape for getting into the tight spaces underneath my seats. 

Word to the wise: when you go to remove the hoses from their little canisters, pull with force. I stood there for a couple of moments as I attempted to gingerly remove it, and thought the hose was stuck. I soon realized that I looked like an idiot, and just gave the vacuum a tug, and it came right out. 

Overall, I definitely say thumbs up. I had been hoping for a little rag to wipe out the interior, but am not sure if the rag was part of one of the other packages, so I will investigate again, and let you know.",high
"When I was a dancer I always came here for everything. Shoes, leotards, skirts, and accessories. They have every type of dance shoe and a wide variety of everything dancers need and want. 

I'm not sure how many dance shops are in the area, but all of my instructors always recommended this place which is not very close to our studio. The staff is all very kind and knowledgeable which trust me is a very good thing. Dance shoes can get confusing! There are at least three different kind of tap shoes! 

Dee's also has costume rentals so if you ever need a crazy costume at the last minute Dee's can help you out with that too!",high
"My wife and I were looking for a dinette table. We looked at many places and ended up at the RoomStore. We found a great table and decided to purchase the item. 

The salesman was nice and didn't provide too much pressure. 

There is a LARGE selection of items-couches, tables, chairs, dressers etc.

My problem was that we bought the table and had a deferred pickup due to moving into a new home several weeks down the road. I placed a small down payment to reserve my item. After several weeks, I contacted the RoomStore to pick up my item since I just moved into my new home. My item was not in stock and was told to call back later in the week. I called 4 days later and was informed the item was now available. 

Today, I went to pay the balance of my purchase and take home the table. Small problem, the table and chairs are not at this location.  I was given the choice to pick up the item at the distribution center 30 minutes away or wait until until Tuesday. I wish that during my several contacts during this process that someone would have told me that I wouldn't be able to pick up my item here or wait several other days. I was not happy! Now I have to go back once again to pick up the table and chairs.",high
"I like this store. It is not perfect, it is not a real farmer's market, but they have many things which other stores do not carry. 

First of all, their fresh sausages made from scratch daily are to die for. Even if you don't like the store overall, just go there, buy a few different sausages and grill them with 100% natural wood charcoal. (Please, do not use lighter fluid! Take a piece of bounty, soak it in some cheap olive oil and you will ignite anything)
If you see 15 different kinds of sausage and don't know which one you may like, ask for their sausage menu; there is a description and list of all ingredients.

Then lets go to their meat department. Grass fed meet. It is not something you will see at any regular store. Is it good? It is worth extra? I'm a skeptic, but I found it to be way better than a regular meat.  Grass fed ground beef was so good! We made burgers and I could definitely taste the difference. 
Grass fed filet mignon was also very nice. It was not better than USDA prime filet mignon from Costco, but it was way better than regular corn fed  filet mignon. I wish farmers would go back to the old times, when they were not controlled by 5 corporations and nobody was forcing cows to eat corn, but I digress...

Need real organic eggs and willing to pay $5 per dozen? No problem, they are here. Frankly, I could not tell that these organic eggs were way better than regular eggs for half the price, but maybe people who bake can tell the difference...

Also, if you're looking for that particular brand of sour cream, butter, kefir  (lowfat yogurt), most likely, you will find it there - they carry many different brands and it seems they do not favor one over another. 

Try organic bananas and tell me they taste the same as regular ones. They do not, they are way better, they have flavor and they are sweet. They almost taste like bananas you would get on Caribbean islands. The one they sell to you the same day they take it off the tree... when it was already yellow and ripe Try peaches and apricots from Chile. They taste like peaches and apricots. Yes, some will have marks, dents and will not look perfect, you have to select, but I rather spend 3 extra minutes picking good ones than get tasteless, but all perfectly looking fruits.

Now, bad. Of course, they do not always have best fruits and vegetables and a lot of them have a tag ""Mexico"". It is unfortunate that ""grown in Mexico"" is associated with poor produce nowadays. Mexico has a great climate and they can definitely grow tasty, pesticide free fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, the market drives demand in a capitalist economy. Many people still look for huge and cheap. Companies provide huge and cheap. Some people are poor, they don't have money to buy quality produce and overpay for organic.  It is sad, but unless we stop buying crappy produce, organic will be super expensive for a while (no competition).

These huge see through plastic bins filled with different nuts seems like a great idea at first, but way too unsanitary. People open these bins with their dirty hands, dip into them, cough and sneeze next to them and that's where you get your nuts from? No way! At least, not for me.

Fish section looks sad, which seems to be a trend in every AZ supermarket. You can find better fish in our area at Costo (huge amounts, good for big families), sometimes AJs (not always though), Mekong plaza supermarket or Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket. That's it.  if you know any other places where I can get fish which does not smell fishy, please let me know.

A lot of their organic produce, including potato is wrapped with a sticky label which says organic on every item. Ughh... it was so annoying to remove wrap around labels from every potato that at the end I didn't not care for the taste - I just wanted to finish peeling them. I guess, the store has to identify organic food somehow, but these extremely sticky labels are not a good idea. Think of something else, Sprout.

So, this Sprout store is not perfect, but I will continue visiting it every week and look forward to some  improvements in the future.",high
"I'm a complete dive bar junkie. Whether I'm in a big city, or small town I always seek out the local spots. I was in Tempe with work and we happened to drive into town right at last call so we searched for the closest bar which just happened to be Monkey Pants. After we got over laughing at the name and the paint job on their truck...we went in and were greeted by the waitress right away. It wasn't too busy especially for a Friday night but the place is huge! The bartender was very attentive and adorable. 

 I really wish I could've made another stop at this bar before I went back home..I saw a bunch of posters for all these theme nights and great deals. Reading previous reviews it sounds like they have parties going on like this all the time. Great bar!",high
"I forgot they built a bunch of FF places along Deer Valley Rd over the last several years, until my bro Daren C reminded me (shout out).

I've been making the rounds to various area Arby's using the shit out of the free BBQ Bacon Cheddar Roastburger (arbys.com/coupon and today's the last day!)

I thought I'd try out another store to avoid wearing out my welcome on Bell Rd., and I'm glad I did.

This is a clean, efficient operation.  The building's pretty new, with a large dining area full of a variety of walled areas and nooks and crannies, giving many of the tables a private feel.
There's even a big atrium window, and a real, live 15' or so ficus tree growing indoors out of the floor in the dining area.  Great atmosphere for this kind of place.

The service was quick and friendly.  I could tell that the young guy at the counter thought the manager barking orders was being a dick, but he took it in stride, smiling and saying ""yes, sir"" the whole time.  ""richard"" the manager was only doing what it takes to keep a FF store running smoothly, though, and young guy will someday get a job selling cars or something, and look back thankfully on all 'richard' taught him about  upselling and add-ons, smiling and being friendly. 

Bad on Arby's for getting rid of regular french fries, though, as they now only have curly or potato cakes (which are great, but i always appreciate variety).
btw BBQ Bacon Cheddar Roastburger kicks butt.",high
"This place rocks!!  We bought 750 sq ft of tile a few months ago to install on our own and we had no idea what we were doing.  They helped us every step of the way. We made several visits over the course of about 3 months and everyone we talked to was helpful and knowledgable. I will absolutely go back when we re-do the floors in the rest of the house.

And the prices are the best.  I am a bargain shopper and will research prices for months before making a large purchase and that is exactly what I did when we embarked on this project.  I researched prices all over... online, in stores, with contractors, etc and Floor and Decor by far had the best prices.  The entire floor cost less than $1500 in tile, materials, and tools.

Now, Betitos offers one dollar tacos on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.  I haven't tried their tacos yet, but I intend to try them in the future.",high

The fries were pretty good, but I don't think they were anything above average.  The burger, though, I thought left a lot to be desired.  It was juicy, but I would actually call it more grease-laden than truly juicy.  I like a moist burger, but I don't want grease dripping off the bun.  That was my major problem.

"I've done the Shabu Fondue more times than I can count!  Usually, I order a cheese fondu for myself, and my main man gets a Shabu dish.  They both apply the same concepts... dip something fresh into something very hot and cook it yourself with long sticks.  Mm!  I've tried all the cheese fondues, and the Swiss is my favorite.  That smell is unforgettable.  I've tried all the Shabu sauces too, and they're all pretty strong, so they season those boring vegetables right up.  The cocktail menu should not be over-looked.  The caramel apple martini is the best!!!  Now the chocolate fondue....  Oh it's so good!  They serve it with marshmallows, fruit and even a slice of cheesecake to dip in!  For a very small price, you can also add a shot of liquor.  (I personally always add a shot of Bailey's to add some flavor.)  This is a PERFECT date restaurant, and it's not bad for groups either.

Must try if your craving a soda different from the normal selections offered.  But, they do have the standby soda selections available as well.  Stop in, burgers have some crazy combinations to try.",high
"Rally burger is a pretty great alternative to McD's or BK, and its somewhat unfortunate that there aren't more locations in the Phoenix area. Their seasoned fries are awesome and even better with chili. What I was really impressed with, though, is their value burger selection and flavor. A simple rally burger is a buck and change and seems like some of the non-value burgers at other fast food. Good condiment to meat ratio, and flavorful. And no skimping here...you get all the condiments even on a value burger: lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion...all that. The other thing I really liked was they have a value buffalo chicken burger which was actually really tasty. All in all, yes its fast food, but its a different flare with unique options and arguably better quality in some areas.",high

Had there big breakfast (forgot what it was called), and had a cup of joe and people watched. The food was awesome and the wonderful ladies of Scottsdale are entertaining, it's saturday morning and ladies are rollin in this place like it's a fashion show, to top it off one lady had to reapply her mascara a few times to make sure she was breakfast chic!! Awesome!!",low
"Treated my sister-in-law to a message here on Super Bowl Sunday.  They have great hours & were very accommodating even though we only made our appts about 24 hours in advance.  When we booked, the receptionist (who was really helpful and nice) mentioned the groupon promotion ($40 for $100 worth of services) as well as SpaFinder gift cards.  We thought we could combine them, and we arrived at our appt to find that they weren't supposed to combine discounts.  But the receptionist made an exception and we were really appreciative!

The massage was nice, could have used a little more pressure.  Cute atmosphere and friendly/helpful staff.  I would come back, especially with SpaFinder/discounts.",high

"After four years of living in AZ I finally found Mexican food that appeals to me and my husband. Lets just say they changed my husbands view on tacos. He never swayed from eating vegetarian burritos until he got a hold of their carne asada tacos. In the last 4 months we lived in AZ we went there almost every week and brought friends, whom now can't get enough of them too.
They are reasonably priced, have great customer service and everything we have eaten so far has been fabulous. If you are looking for great food and you're not concerned with being in a fine dining Mexican restaurant, then look no further. 
We miss you Los Taquitos.....",high
We love Niro's! The hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches are dynamite! The Greek salad is big and fresh. The gyros are also excellent. I'm a French fry junkie and these are my favorite in Phoenix!

"Wow. 
The food and atmosphere here are great. 
The music was a little too loud, but, for a weekend away, this place hit the spot perfectly. 
The wait was rather lengthy, so we stalked the bar until some folks left, then had our dinner there. 
I had the largest shrimp cocktail of my life, some really good wine, and grilled asparagus. 
There are so many delicious options in Scottsdale, but, this is pretty specific in vibe. Check it out.",high
Awesome little hole in the wall in Tempe.  There isnt much room to sit and it isn't fancy but if you want good food this is the place to go.  A pasty is basically a calzone(only better) with a variety of different types of fillers.  I had the bangers and mash.  The wife had the Italian.  Everything was great served promptly and with a smile.  It's not Scottsdale fancy and that's what I like about it.  Best part is you can get a hearty meal with a soda for under $10.  If you want beer expect to pay a bit more.,high
"This place has a great selection of Korean dishes and even some Japanese.  This is a family favorite, from the stews, the BBQ, the bibimbop, to the side dishes.  The staff is always friendly, sometimes a little slow, but always a great experience.  There is a sushi bar and you can either cook the BBQ at the table (2 people or more) or have it cooked for you in the kitchen.",high
"I went there on a Mon around 9:30 am. It was a ghost town and we got seated very quick.

I have to say they have the most comfortable seats!  I didnt sit in the chair but a like bench couch thing? Super soft.

The whole decor and music vibe was really cool, I really dugg it.

My girlfriend got  french toast (because she is a bitch and has to be super toned and fit with out working out or eating good)
which came with chicken apple sausage. Ok, heres the thing about that, I hate sausage(insert lesbian joke here) but it didnt have the typical sausagy flavors. It was really  really good. It was tangy salty and sweet. 
The french toast was extremely good. I think it may have been dipped in blueberry before cooked?

The waitress was super accomodating, and nice. 

Oh and they do have french press coffee which I was disappointed by , but after I had it.. holly crap best coffee ever!!!! it was smooth had good flavors, no bitterness at all. 

The only use butter and vegetable oil which is soo nice to see they dont load you up with horrible for you margerine. 

My only complaint is, I ordered a sandwich and got a totally different one. When I told them she went to the cooks and found out they didnt have that bread and randomly added egg? 

She took it back and it was no big deal but she informed me it was only a month old and were still learning the menu. 

Kinda weird but nothing big, my new favorite breakfast place.",high

first of all, they gave away rifles to the first 800 people we were there on black friday. again, im not in cali anymore! this place is an outdoors lover dream. and on top of selection and discounted prices...its almost like an amusement park: 

aquarium room with freshwater fish, back natural history museum-eque taxidermy displays, heads of animals and maps of where they originate from hanging throughout the huge main room, a chocolate shop, and entire cafeteria. 

basically, you can make a day out of cabela's. we were there for 4 hours and i didn't even realize.

As all have mentioned before, interesting and delicious wine selections and bruschetta to die for [I am a fan of the proscuitto/fig/marscarpone and the smoked salmon]. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. 

The bad: okay, the not-so-good...hideous parking [but there's a $3 valet] and really loud. Interesting vibe and a mixed crowd. Would bet its great when the weather cools down and patio seating is more appealing that the current August sauna. 

All in all, I'd go back, eat. drink. eat some more.",high

"First time ordering calamari salad...which had a strong onion (??) flavor and tasted weird...Being raised on Vietnamese food, the strangest of foods has been in my mouth, but I think this falls into the acquired taste category...As in I never acquired a taste for this.

Pad thai was okay...the noodles were a bit over seasoned. I felt like I should've eaten it with rice to tone down the flavor.

Papaya salad was good...still on the look out for that authentic not watered down version, though. Just like my friend's mom makes it! Yum!

Thai omelet. Good.

The people were really friendly as well, which helps, but you KNOW I'm all about the food.

I had takeout and the box for the calamari salad read: ""Carimali Salad"". :) I love it!",high
"I am not a big beer drinker, so I can't attest to the many different options they have in that area, but I can tell you about their martinis.

They have a huge menu of specialty martinis and other cocktails that are all pretty darn tasty if you ask me.  My friend really liked the chocolate something or other martini, I had a pear one that was delicious and another pal really enjoyed the pomegranate press.

The food is pretty good or I was buzzed.  Or both.  We had the cheese pizza and an onion ring tower (both half-off for happy hour).  Which, by the way, truly is a tower of onion rings.  And then the waitress brought out a free piece of cheesecake for my birthday.  It was a great time had by all. 

But the best thing about Yard House is the location.  It's right by Kona and Z Tejas and if you start right at 3pm, you can hit happy hour at each location and then take the free trolley to Giligin's. Yes, I did this on Friday and it was TONS of fun. Try it.",high
"The good thing about Pearl is their all-day everyday Happy Hour menu.  There are about 5-6 specialty rolls on there for $7 (regular price is about $10+).  I highly recommend the Fish Shticks - imitation crab rolled & fried in tempura batter, topped w/ spicy tuna and a sweet aioli.  There are also the basics like California roll or Spicy Tuna roll for $4.  I love their Happy Hour mini bomber menu.  Get the Fruit Bomb! - vodka w/ a guava juice chaser.

Anyway, I finally got a chance to eat there on a Sunday and take advantage of their Viva Las Vegas promotion - you get 10% off and get to roll a dice and get an additional discount or other prizes.  WELL, after my cousin & I finished our dinner of Fish Shticks and the Deep V roll, we asked about the Vegas promotion.  Of course they would tell me that they don't do any promotions in the months of July & August.  Um, that would've been a good a disclaimer to have on your website!  This would've dropped 1 star from my rating, but I give it 4 stars for the food, mini bombers, & daily happy hour menu.

Beware of service on Friday nights though.  They are terrible!  They forget your food orders & are super slow to get drinks.  I understand that the place is super busy on a Friday night, but that's no excuse for the waitresses to take their time flirting with guys rather than coming to check on your table.",high

I arrived at the hotel and was informed that they did not have my King bed available, I never get how you reserve a room and then they are out. I asked if I could get an upgrade, which they obliged and put me on the executive business floor. The floor smelled of cigarette smoke. The hotel needs some repairs overall, which they said they were going to remodel. Room was clean, some dirt behind the bed, yes I look everywhere and the little closet was in very rough shape. What I was really upset about is that these hotels and our agreement is supposed to have a Sleep Number bed. It's even advertised. Nope, not in the executive floor rooms. Makes sense right? My mattress was worn and not comfortable at all, prob the worst night sleep ever. Was not rested for the big meeting the next day. IAsk for the Sleep number!",high
"I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back. Second time, onion strings were so greasy I couldn't eat them, burger was okay. Third time, yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever. 

Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross. Upon the lovely's complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we 'didn't have a better experience'. Um. A better experience???

Now the crab rangoon were pretty good and I was actually bummed that you only got four but it was only about $2.50 so I cannot complain too much. The fried rice was just ok. For it to be house friend rice, which comes with beef, chicken, pork and shrimp, I can understand not having alot of the shrimp but it didn't have much of anything. I mean it tasted ok, but I was hoping for a little bit more meat than there was. It was a quick meal considering I didn't really know what I wanted to eat anyway. I may give it another try and hope that it's a little better next time.",high
"Only went to the downstairs bar, but cannot wait to return!  Very cool with the rock and copper features and leather couches.  We sat at the bar and were served drinks that you pour yourself.  Is this a new trend?  He gave us little glass bottles of tonic and coke with little spoons to stir our drinks with.  Those little spoons were so cute I was almost tempted to put them in my purse.  If another couple hadn't been hogging the fireplace the whole time, we would have sat there.  Maybe next time.  We'll try to food too.",high

"I usually do not write reviews, but was so horrified by my experience I had to. Went for a late night bite and drink with a friend, they were fairly busy so we had a seat at the bar. As I frequent The Moon often, I was happy to see the bar was busy as well. The bartender quickly came over and was noticably intoxicated, as she could not even tell me the flavors of vodka they had. We ordered our drinks, and watched as she broke glass into the ice, knocked over glassware and broke a beer bottle. As we looked around most of the guests had the same look of horror on their face. We decided to order some food, as she spilled my drink on us (refilled it with something completely different) and she could barely even talk at this point. We saw management watch her behavior and do nothing, as she preceded to grab dirty glassware and refill it with beer. I was so appauled by this we left befpre finishing our drinks or food. I'm not sure what she was on but if its visible to paying customers it should be visible to management. Being beyond embarassed for the establishment, I would doubt I will come back, sad as we would frequent the Moon 2-3 times a week. Horrible.",low

I bring my fourteen year old daughter along for services once in awhile, and on two occasions here they managed to seat me and skip her for other clients that did not have appointments.  They wont accept a tip from your debit/credit card which is pretty inconvenient if you don't carry cash.  They use a cheap base coat in an unmarked bottle that leaves my polish job looking funky. My mother was a loyal client until she got an infection in her toe after a visit.  I don't like to write bad reviews but this place does not deserve your business.",low

Just amazingly tasty, simple, pizza with quality ingredients made the right way in a brick oven.  Pizzeria Bianco might have em by an inch just based on pizza alone, but if you don't want to wait 2.5 hours for a pie, Cibo is the place to be, and almost as good.  And although Bianco has a 2.5 hour wait whereupon i generally drink wine for the duration(which might be part of the reason the pie is so good), the limoncello at Cibo generally floors me just as well in a quarter of the time..",high

But, let's be honest here. I mostly go for the photo booth. By far the best photo booth in town... good quality pictures (not cheap like the ones inside the mall) and they have little masks, glasses, and mustaches-on-a-stick you can use in case you're tired of flashing the peace sign or making that horrendous duck face.

Soda. Candy. Toys. Photo booth. Don't kid yourself. You're never too old for that ish.",high
"Came here the other night in a party of 17.  Overall the experience was satisfying.  The waitresses were nice (yes, some had serious cleavage) and they were mostly on top of things - ordering the kids plates first, getting drinks/orders put in.

The drinks were huge - I had a margarita which was served in a wine carafe.  Unfortunately there was hardly any alcohol in it so I supplemented with a shot of silver tequila.  Probably could have used a couple more shots!

I had the baby back ribs.  The order was huge and I did my best.  The meat was tender and the sauce spicy.  Overall it exceeded my expectations (which weren't too high given what I've read here).  The plus was the entertainment value with people trying to ride the mechanical bull.  Only one person from our group did it - after 4 shots of Jack Daniels!

Overall a great place to go to if you're looking for a casual place with some eye candy, decent food, and side entertainment.",high
"I really wan to like this place more because it gets some of the best acts in town, but it is cramped, stuffy, the stage is too low, the sound quality is not great and they do not serve alcohol so the crowd is kind of stiff and non-fun.  I will keep going because as previously stated, they get some of the best acts in town, but... let's hope they work on the format.",high
"Finally a Japanese owned sushi bar beside Sakana in Ahwatukee!  I guess Sushi Ken has been here for a while, but I didn't realize what a great find it was.  

My wife and I went there to splurge on Japanese sushi since they are better than the typical Korean owned sushi places which are most common in the Phoenix area.

"I want the Garage to do well. It is still a work in progress, though. Three of us visited two weeks ago. We were sat right next to a group of 40 - 55 year old ladies out for a surprise birthday. What's with that anyways. Do you really need to go to a somewhat small restaurant with your pack of ""girls,"" and occupy a large swath of the dining area? Do you need all the paraphernalia (collages, centerpieces, hats)? I was seriously waiting to see a youngish birthday girl. Nope, she was the oldest. 60, easy. Act your age. While you're at it, you are not a size six anymore. Needless to say, it was loud. At least one of the revelers apologized right when we sat. As if that's any conciliation for the volume 11 cackling. 

First off, the Garage has good brewskis. Not a huge supply, but what they have is quality. We had wings and truffle oil deviled eggs. Both were great. I had Schriner's Sausage Flat bread, and it was great. Wife had something, I forget, and said it was good. Friend had some large salad and said it was good, too. Overall, food was better than most. 

So, why the three stars you ask? Service. Why do some cool places slip up on this? Is it because they hire ""cool people"" or friends that don't really want to work? First off, a server (we were seated at the entrance/ exit to the kitchen) dropped a glass bottle of ketchup five feet from my foot. My wife and I had splatter on our jeans and glass near our sandal clad feet. Hardly a response. We were handed a rag. Our server not so sympathetically wondered, ""Oh, they almost dropped a bottle of ketchup on you."" The rest of the night just seemed a little disorganized and not relaxing? Every server seemed in the weeds or confused. Empty beer and water glasses. Entrees arrived and empty app plates sat there.

I had to ask for a cold glass to put it in and when I was served the 2nd one, they didn't include it. I had to ask again.

The food:  Pretty good, actually. However, its totally overpriced and the portions are pretty small. So it makes the hurt on the wallet that much more severe.  Our waitress was cool, she put up with a lot of conversations in our group, sometimes being loud and not paying attention.

I also mentioned that the last time we came in, I bought something with a manager special sticker on it but was charged the regular price.  The customer service guy refunded my money with no questions!  Awesome.

Great store, nice selection of bulk items, fresh produce, large service deli, in house bakery with some incredible looking treats, clean.....

I'll definitely be shopping at Bashas!  As if I could rave anymore, it's a LOCALLY owned business!",high
"I've gotten lunch take out here a few times. The only thing I've tried is the drunken noodles. While I think they are pretty decent, I have been having serious issues getting the right spicy-nes. The first time I got them, I asked for level 3 spicy. Their spice meter goes from 0-5. I love love hot and spicy Thai food, however these noodles were practically inedible. Yet, they were so delicious at the same time I devoured the entire thing. And I felt like I was going to die later, as my stomach felt like a fishnet stocking...
The second time I ordered them I asked for level 2 spicy. This time they were not spicy at all. At all!! They were so bland. I mean, they still tasted good, but were missing that drunken noodle kick! So, at this point I don't know what to do. Obviously every cook there must have a different idea of what each number means. 
The last time I ordered from here, I simply said drunken noodles. I didn't specify a spicy level. I figured maybe this would give me the perfect in between spicy that I so desired! Well, when I got them, they were more bland than the level 2. And tasted kinda weird. 
I will give them another try as they are right across the street from my work, and I hope we can work out our spicy issues! 
4 stars for the service, they're really friendly here
2 stars for the food, until we can work out our issues
And 4 stars for the convenience!",high

This is not my favorite style of pizza but nonetheless it was especially good pizza.  The service staff was top notch and the store is very warm and inviting.

We will be back!",low
"Loved this place since it open but they have changed their menu up a little and it seems they have cut corners and products out of there repartee.  The sandwich I got this weekend was very bland and somewhat disappointing in portion size I've grown accustom to at the ""WBC"" and they've discontinued making their bread salad. (Very disappointing)  I will be back but with fewer expectations I guess.

I received an apology letter from the founder and an offer to refund my money.  I don't need a refund... this is not what Yelp is about, but it was really refreshing to know that a company still cares about their customers reviews.  After re reading my review it may have sounded worse than my experience actually was.  The sandwich I got was a new one from their menu named the Spicy Chipotle Egg Sandwich, it was good but I like SPICY!!!  I may order it again and just ask for an extra egg and some more chipotle sauce.  The gentleman did give me the recipe for the salad that I've enjoyed in the past.   

This type of service is what makes a customer for life.",high
"As I revealed in a previous review, my family loves InnSuites. This location is nestled in the Squaw Peak Mountain Preserve, close to the prestigious Biltmore area, and offers easy access to downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale and the Camelback corporate corridor. 

InnSuites offers comfotable, clean rooms for a very rasonable price. And as with all of the InnSuites locations, the Northern location includes amenities such as free social hour and free hot breakfast with eggs, potatoes, waffles, toast, cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee, milk & juices. There isn't really much within walking distance at this location, so either plan to hang around the pool a lot or you'll need to have a car.",high
"I have never been treated so rudely in a retail establishment ever. I went to the shop with my daughter, her friend and my niece...all young adults. I showed a picture of the project we wanted make to the woman working there and she scoffed at me.  I noticed she was playing Solitaire on her iPad...apparently we interrupted her game. She then proceeded to tell us that she would have to open the door and turn on the air conditioner because her mother, the owner of the store, would be back soon and is extremely allergic to fragrance.  The girls and I had body lotion on, this is the desert for crying out loud, and not one of us had perfume on.  Then the mother arrived, there was a brief conversation behind the curtain and she walk out with a towel over her mouth and nose commenting on having to open the door. Seriously? Unfortunately we had picked out some stuff to buy and I'm sorry that I spent the $68. I could have spent more but the experience was so distasteful that we hurried out. If I knew how to give less than 1 star, I would. It was unbelievable. I empathize with the woman and her allergies, but the situation could have been handled so much better.",low
"Whoa! This is the kind of laid back, homegrown, down right delicious place I expect to find in Seattle - not Phoenix! What an awesome surprise. Came here for brunch on Sunday and was so impressed that I can say I will make it a point to come back! All the breads and desserts are made in house and I was told everything is made with fresh local ingredients when possible.

The atmosphere is great. We sat outside and it was nice with prompt service, casual vibe that reminded me of Seattle or Portland, and the FOOD.... Wowie.

There were three of us... all three did omelette's of different kinds. I recommend the Local Breeze, sans prosciutto. So good! You can get potatoes or spicy cottage cheese as a side - I went with the cottage cheese and it was delish. The bread is also amazing. Nice thick slices for the toast. Best whole wheat bread I've ever had in Phoenix.

Speaking of the bread - they have a killer menu of different french toast options. If I had not been on carb restriction, I would have had one for sure. NEXT TIME. The PB&J and the Nutella sound especially good. Our friend got a half order and it looked terrific. 

I cannot stress how good everything was. But I can only give them 4 stars and not 5 because the coffee was really bad. A good brunch should have good coffee to go with. 

I will be back for brunch for sure and would also like to give them a try for dinner or lunch sometime. 

Give this place a shot in downtown Phoenix!",low
"I see a lot of four stars...perhaps I'm too generous with my five stars. I'm a giver.

Attended a party for Georgie on Friday night and had a great time. 
Easy to find, easy to park, easy to get a drink. 

Plus- HEY they have the same turbo nozzle a/c vents that I have in my home. I could live there. Exposed brick? Me too! Felt right at home.
I love the way they display their art, I'm assuming from local artists. 

I would prefer to not have to walk down a flight of stairs after a night of drinking. However, no problems there - thankfully. :)",high
"Had a very disappointing experience today.  All four in our group were disappointed in the quality of the food, especially the overripe cantaloupe and soggy potatoes.  The place was busy which won't be the case much longer if they don't improve their fare.  The service staff was friendly although I thought it interesting that no one asked us about our experience.   If they were interested, now they know.",high
"Warning, don't get deterred that there aren't any seats for you when you walk in... that's a good sign that the the tables are full with everyone stuffing their faces.  I waited for about 15 minutes for a table to free up, and I'm glad I did.  It was kind of a chilly night and I was feeling for something hot.  I decided on the seafood noodle soup and pork pies.  The noodles soup broth was lightly seasoned with a hint of white pepper (just the way I like it), the noodles were thick and hearty, and the portion was substantial.  The pork pies (3) were like a flattened pot sticker that had been pan-fried on both sides, Yum!

Definitely, a place serving up genuine Chinese food with the finesse of a home-cooked meal. I can't wait to go back!",high
"I chose this place because of the 100% rating on urbanspoon.com & the proximity to the hotel my family was staying at. We were absolutely blown away. Don't let the location of a strip mall deter you from this place. The food is absolutely perfect. I had the bouillabaisse while my 2 table mates had steak. Each dish was prepared perfectly. The service was also some of the best service we have ever had at any restaurant. The waitress was so attentive & detail oriented. I never had to ask for anything, she always knew exactly what I needed. My water & iced tea was never below halfway. At the end of the meal, the owner/chef came out to greet us & that was such a nice gesture. We were so happy to compliment him & his restaurant. My visiting family even said that they would gladly come back to this place on their next visit. This place is so great & you just need to go visit it!",high

"3 friends and I went for restaurant week.  Iruna has great ambiance and charm.  The service was top-notch, and our server made excellent wine recommendations.  The desserts were amazing.  The other food was just ok.  

Here's what we had:

tapas - tortilla espanola (which was complimentary) was delicious; chistorra (chorizo in cider w/ baby artichokes) was also good; pan con tomate was surprising because it didn't seem to be tapas.  rather it was huge chunks of grilled bread that didn't work well to distribute flavors and was oily.

entrees - trout with salsa navarra, eggplant, roasted peppers, onion and tomato was very nicely cooked and had a nice balance of flavors.  filet mignon with tomatoes and salbitxada was order medium rare but delivered very well done and over-salted.  It was refired, and v2 was the right temperature but still over-salted.  

we glanced at the patio on the way out which looks fantastic.  We return to try some other tapas and sangria on their outdoor couches.",high

"Sushi is not just a meal, it's an experience...Everything from the way fish looks to the crisp green of the seaweed is art.  The smell of the sake and the sound of crisp sizzle on the grill create an environment conducive to stretching the palette.  Yasu's does this like no other sushi place...The fish is pristine, the rice like air, and the flavors intense and varied.  My wife and I live a stone's throw from this place you would never see it if you didn't know it was there.  It's like a little secret that is starting to get out...All I can say is that it is hands down the BEST sushi in Phoenix, period.  Get the fried oyster rolls, get the grilled mackerel or trout...just try it!",high
"Great food, clean a bit old but nice",high
"This place is located right on Mill, with a patio that is right in the action.

they gimmick of this primarily college bar is their frozen drinks, which are tossed around in Kwik-E-Mart squishy style windows behind the bar that you can see. they come in plenty of flavors like red, green, orange, etc. seriously, they all taste the same to me, and after a couple they only become recognizable by color.

the frozen drinks are loaded with sugar and everclear (like the HIgh Octane) so it only takes two to feel super drunk and have a real bad stomach ache (which feels even worse the next day).

they also have regular beers and liquor, and even a menu - which i never realized til someone sitting next to me was presented  a hamburger at their table. 

overall it's not my style, gimmicky, co-edy and obnoxious, and i only end up here when someone else wants to go here for some reason that i can never fathom.",high
"This Dunkin Donuts is hit or miss.

When i run in here for just coffee, the service is usually very fast and prompt. When i run in there to order coffee and food, that usually becomes a circus.

"01/04/2012

I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of ""Daddy Long Legs,"" ATC's first musical production, at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!  

I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend ""Daddy Long Legs"" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!  (Much thanks to McGinnis and Hancock for their lovely harmonies-- I cherished them!)",high
"Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is. However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st. It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top. Be very careful it's easy to loose the trail on that side too. 
Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend. Parking can be bad at peak times on weekends--I definetely recommend late afternoon hiking, less exhaustion from heat, less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top. 
Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians.",high

My advice, if you are gonna go, go early and lock down a good location...",high

"Service, awesome.  Food, spectacular.  Price, unbeatable. 

I can't tell you how many times this restaurant has saved my life.  Richard is very understanding when I come in completely hung over, and knows to put extra kimchi in my side dishes.  

Also, in terms of the local ""$20 all you can eat"" sushi specials, this is the only place that ever pops into my head as  a place I need to go.  Their sushi chef if spectacular and super friendly so it's always a nice time sitting at the bar.

They have a special lunch menu that is served only during the week, so you can expect the dinner menu on Saturday and Sunday regardless of the time you go.  Both menus are amazing, it's just that the menus are slightly different in their options so if you have a specific craving (and I often do) you might have to concede to something different once you get there.  It's mildly annoying, but the food never disappoints so I let it go.

Try it, you wont be disappointed.",high

"My boyfriend and I decided to drive around Scottsdale and find a place for dinner on a Saturday night. Our initial impression of the place was that it was going to be too rich for our blood; however, we figured we would give it a shot. The decor reminded my boyfriend of nightclub scene from Scarface. 

When they sat us down initially we were right next to the kitchen which wasn't too pleasant. So we asked to be moved to another location and the hostess moved us into their private dinning room which we loved. 

Our server was very friendly and informative, yet also gave us space. We ordered crab cakes to start things off. They were excellent but slightly over priced given the portion size. Then we ordered a bottle of wine that was very reasonably priced and to our liking for $24 - a nice Argentinian Malbec. We decided on this bottle after our server brought us several other tastes. I ordered the soup of the day and my boyfriend got a caesar salad. Both were solid. For entrees I got a salmon with asparagus and my boyfriend ordered seared ahi tuna. Both were cooked to perfection.

Overall, being in the private dining room was perfect, noise level wise, and all of the staff made sure everything was up to par without being too over zealous. I would highly recommend this place.",high
"being new to the area, i'm really on a quest to nail down my basic food groups: thai, persian, and mexican. mexican i've got down i think, but the other two i've kind of been baffled by. luckily i have my very own personal tour guide who invited me to lunch at yupha's one day. 

the place is pretty cute but can get pretty crowded when in the full swing of lunch. the tables are kind of close together, so be sure you arent carrying a big purse or anything otherwise you'll be whacking people in the head with it.

i had the pad thai for lunch. HUGE lunch portions. i could barely finish a third of it and i had a ton to take home for dinner. also if you arent into spicy, i'd definitely go mild. medium spicy is pretty groovin, but i dont think it would work out well for someone who only wants a little spice. yupha's also has an interesting salad bar/soup thing that comes with some of the lunches. check out the salad with the peanut dressing. mmmmmm peanut dressing. i loves it. 

service is fast and friendly. take your check up to the front if you want to get out of here quickly. i think yupha's is going to be my work lunch thai place :). garlic beef here i come!",high
"I spent most of my first year being legal drinking age at this wild, college bar. It was fun then, but I got older, it wore on me. It's a big ASU bar and there's no escaping the drunk college kids. The guys can usually be found on the patio barking lame pick up lines at the female passerbys and the ladies are usually grinding it up on the small dance floor on the weekend nights.

With the summer heat, Fat Tuesdays frozen drinks are appreciated. But if you don't want to drink them with the college crowd, hit the bar during the day or early evenings.",high
"I think I may be addicted to this place. This location is a  bit out of my way, but after a terrible experience at the Superstition Springs Buffalo Wild Wings this became my go-to place. All of the servers are incredibly nice and efficient, and my order always comes exactly as I ordered. I've been here twice during the 2011 Stanley Cup finals and was happy that they had the sound on loud enough in the bar, but not too loud that you had to shout to the other people at the table. The food is consistently perfect, the atmosphere is great, and all of the employees I have encountered are friendly. The drink specials aren't too bad either. You can't go wrong!",high
"Me and my best friend wanted to check this place out. We both enjoyed it. Here are my pros and cons:

Pros:
- There is ample parking across the street and the lightrail stops right by the bar so its very easily accesible.

- The drinks are decently priced. I mostly had beer and they were all about $4 each. Bartenders were friendly, cute, and fast.

- The music was good. I wanted to dance my little butt off.

- The drag queens were fabulous.

- No cover.

Cons:
- We went on a Saturday night and the place was dead. I really wanted to dance but there was no one in the other rooms getting their groove on. I was disappointed.

- Its mostly men. There were a few lesbian couples there but its mostly gay men. (This could be a pro, depending on how I'm feeling.)

I look forward to going back on a busier night. From what I have heard, Fridays are the day to go so we will be checking it out another Friday.",high
"My boyfriend and I decided to try Boulders out last night because we wanted some good beer and it's within walking distance of my condo. Good choice on our behalf! 

We arrived around 10:30 pm, so we took advantage of reverse happy hour ($1 off most pints on draft). They were also having half price pizza night, but we had already eaten pizza earlier in the evening, so we did not get a chance to try the pizza. Had we been hungry, it seemed like a great deal.

I was VERY impressed by their beer list! They had the biggest beer selection I've seen anywhere. When I was shopping at a specialty store last week, I noticed a ""Maui Brewing Co. Coconut Porter"" that l was very curious to try - but I passed it up because it was $10 for a 4-pack (ouch). I asked the bartender at Boulders (Rob) if they happened to have that specific beer - and to my utter surprise they did! I was happy I was able to try it out before shelling out ten bucks to buy a four pack at the store. Two thumbs up! 

Speaking of Rob the bartender, he was great. Very fast to take care of all the customers around us as well as my boyfriend and I. Made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. 

Overall, I had a really good first experience at Boulders on Broadway, and I will definitely be back. I dug the old-school ambiance with the wood paneled bar, we received very good service, and the selection of beer was amazing - truly something for everyone. 

If you live in the area, I'd recommend checking it out!
I plan to get some friends together and go back for one of their ""team trivia nights"" soon - sounds like a blast.",high

But, holy cow! The wine selection is VERY good. The staff are friendly and helpful and make excellent suggestions (thanks for the zinfandel tip! YUMMM). The prices are fair too!

And, as much as I love green chile, my new fave is the fig and gorgonzola app. Still a pannini... I didn't know blue cheese could get that creamy when it melted!

"Pei Wei is always busy, that's gotta mean something right? Wrong. There are restaurants that serve billions yet all they serve is a gross mystery. Pei Wei is no mystery though, the food is cooked in an open air kitchen. Even so, if there were such a thing as Asian fast food, Pei Wei would be cleaner version of it.

Most Pei Wei's are situated in pompous locations where ever there is an AJ Fine Foods, but atleast they aren't located in the ghetto.

As far as the food goes, it is about as Americanized as you can get. So if you live in America and have American taste buds, it will appeal to you. Unfortunately if you want authentic Asian food you won't find it at Pei Wei. I don't understand why they even bother to put chopsticks on the table, the rice isn't even sticky enough to pick it up with. They are for decoration. They are part of the 'fake' Asian dining experience. Apparently, Pei Wei serves food ""manadrian style"" from Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, and China. In the words of Bill Lumbergh, ""Ooo.. yeahh.. I'm just not sure about that."" Having traveled to China I can honestly tell you that Chinese food is different. Apart from the rice, the food lacks vegetable oil and garlic. In China those two ingrediants are used in many dishes and Pei Wei lacks them. When I first started visiting Pei Wei I ordered the Sweet and Sour, but I got sick of it. Sometimes the meat would be tough, sometimes the chicken would clump together all nastily. What I get now-a-days and what I got on this particular day was Mandarin Kung Pao. Even though the dish is spicy, that doesn't mean it has to be dry - and it was. What it was missing was some catalyst to bring out the spicy flavors and make them more vibrant.

The dishes at Pei Wei are family style meaning they are meant to be shared with several people. A dish and a drink will end up costing you about $10. If each person gets one dish, that's a lot of food, probably enough to feed a small village in Africa somewhere. It would be nice if they served each dish in two styles, family and single, large and small. Family style is great if you always visit Pei Wei with your family. But if you are out for lunch with people from work you might not want to share your food with your co-workers. They aren't your family. You don't know them.

Pei Wei is a modern Asian diner that is probably better than most of the mom and pop Asian diners out there, even if most of the food is cooked by Mexi-- I mean Asians.",high

There was plenty of meat and toppings piled on- it definitely filled me up. It's clear the place is a well-loved lunch spot- it was a full house at 1:00. I can't wait to go back.",high
"Great Concept!

My girls love this place. You have to really learn the schedule when the place is really busy (because it gets packed) and that is when the experience is diminished and the potential for getting hurt is heightened.

The big plus is the multitude of things to do. For the smaller,. younger children, they have their own set of trampolines and the bounce houses..well, who doesn't love a good bouncy bounce!

The older kids can experience the main attraction and I will tell you that watching some of the stunts is pretty amazing! Not to mention the dodge ball, foam pit and the maze...2 hours gets eaten up pretty quick.

Whats great about this is that kids are being ACTIVE and really getting a work out. I was out for like 10 minutes and my butt was kicked...so this is a great way to get your kids moving and motivated.

The staff is young, but so is the staff at hot dog on stick...but they keep things pretty well under control and I have only seen one person get hurt in all the times that we have been there. Looking for common sense, good customer service, or a straight answer and you might have better luck talking with the floor.

Worth the money...great value...and fun. A definite two thumbs up in my book.",high
"Totally excited to try this place out, my grandparents, my mom and I (4 of us) came here for some Korean food. It wasn't too busy; just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out. 

Unlike other Korean restaurants, their lunch special selection is very limited. Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda, special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda), or special C, Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken. 

As we were looking at the ""lunch special"" board, the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead. Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom ""are you Chinese?"" Even though she is, my mum looked at me all puzzled as in ""what does that mean?"" The lady proceeded by pointing at the ""seafood pancake"" section on the menu and saying ""I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot."" Good thing my mom didn't hear what she said.. or else... 

So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99), a bulgogi ($6.99), and a beef yakisoba ($7.19). The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini ""kimchi"" buffet bar, with trays of marinated tofu, potato, bean sprout, kimchi, broccoli and some other vegetables. It also has this delicious house special hot sauce. 

By the time we finished a dish of kimchi, the food came, so it didn't take long. The spicy chicken, came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper), was tender, with rice underneath it. The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba. The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat. 

In the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said ""you can't take that home"". I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said ""you are not allowed to take the kimchi home"". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? ""Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?"" She hesitantly gave me a lid.

""Hey, hey you. we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say 'no stealing kimchi'""... only if I said that to her face...

Oh, and when we got home, my brother, aka our food dumpster, took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again.  

Conclusion: If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service, please just go to Chodang. Chodang is WAYYY BETTER, hands down",low
"As I'm always on the chase for some of the best spicy tuna rolls, I would say Yen's is up there in my top 5.  

I haven't been in for happy hour yet, but I hear it is fantastic!  

Word to the wise though...do not get the dessert that looks like a pyramid.  I can't even remember what it is called.  But it claims to have a caramel center...um, not so much!  

If you can avoid the desserts, then this is a great place for sushi and even specialty rolls.  I haven't had any trouble with it being crowded or slow service like some reviews have mentioned.  But I've only been for lunch and then another time late at night.",high
"As a vegetarian and sporadic health nut, I just love TJ's. They have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce, including my beloved broccolini, for 40% of what Safeway charges. Huge selection of frozen veggie-friendly dinners, good for my on-the-go household. Greek yogurt, cheap. Nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine. I try to buy all my supplements here too, as they seem to be a lot less expensive. Yes, I'm all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot.

The downside? It's not one-stop-shopping; a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a ""regular"" grocery store. This particular TJ's is teeny-tiny-small, and always chock-full of obnoxious and/or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons. My favorite is the woman who thinks it's an awesome time to teach little Jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop, and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willy-nilly. I'm all for giving your kid responsibility, but a) you still have to, you know, keep an eye on the kid and b) a super-crowded claustrophobic nightmare like this place after work is not, repeat, NOT the time to do so.",low
"Just a quick update.... Took my parents here for lunch today, and now I have 2 more converts! If anyone is still sleeping on this place, shame on you; you're really missing out. Why? DELICIOUS food made from QUALITY ingredients and FRESHLY prepared hot to order. Good stuff all around!",high

"Fuego Bistro is one of my new favorites! A couple people have recommended it to me, so my boyfriend and I decided to try it for restaurant week. 

We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation to have a drink on the patio. The staff was super welcoming and friendly. Matt enjoyed a mai tai and I had a red sangria - both very refreshing. Our table was ready right on time and we had an awesome waitress who gave great suggestions on ordering... there were so many good looking options on their restaurant week menu. We're sharers, so we ordered with that in mind. 

Drinks: 
We got the pomegranate mojito (very refreshing) and a peach-blood orange mojito (sweet, but very good)

Starters: 
Signature empanadas: Tasty. The focus was the meat, I would have preferred more vegetables inside.
Sauteed prawns: The star here were the sauces - delicious!

Entrees: 
Cola Braised Short Ribs: AMAZING! Some of the best we've ever had. The short ribs were very tender and not fatty at all. The flavor was so good!
Pernil Asado (shredded pork): So delicious!! I made little tacos with their fresh corn tortillas. 

Sides: 
Green chili cornbread casserole: A little drier than I had imagined, but great flavor. 
Maple chiliglazed carrots: The glaze didn't really stand out to me, but good as far as baby carrots go.
Jalapeno creamed corn: I was pleasantly surprised - really enjoyed this one! 
Chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes: A great side with the short rib. 

Dessert: (By this point, we knew we'd need to be rolled out of the restaurant, but we HAD to have dessert since it was part of restaurant week). 
Chocolate chip bread pudding: Really good chocolate chip bread with scoops of malted chocolate crisp ice cream. This was a lot of food after that meal, but I savored the bites I had. The ice cream was excellent!
Banana burrito: exactly what you'd picture with scoops of the same icecream - delicious! 

I can't wait to go back to Fuego and tell my friends about it. Great service, charming atmosphere, and excellent dishes.... Fuego is a winner!",high
"Stopped back in here today for lunch with Arlin B., Robyn N. & Mike C.  They're still delivering the same upscale Asian Buffet experience here as before, including atmosphere, food & table service that are just tops so it's ""Woohoo"" again for this excellent restaurant!!     :-))

"True fine dining has come to the Valley.

If you are looking to have a special dinner, this is the place.  And plan on spending 3 hours as it is a true culinary experience.

The tasting menu consists of options of 4, 5, or 6 courses, and they can be paired with wine, if you like.  This is the way to go and even for tasting portions, they are not micro-mini.

The choices for each course are extensive.  At least 6-10 each.  AND, the coolest part, is that you won't find any ingredient repeated twice.  NONE.  Yes you might find tomatoes in the same night, but they won't be the same type.  That's not easy to pull off, considering the variety of the menu.

But, while you are between courses, Chef Binkley will send out numerous amuse bouche - which, if you don't know, are tiny little one bit or one gulp appetizers like, mini sliders the size of a half dollar, or pancetta mousse in a shot glass.

We ate there for my ex-H's bday, and had 8 amuse bouche.  Also, if you let them know in advance you are there for a special occasion, you will get custom printed menus for everyone at the table mentioning the special event.

The ONLY drawback, is the atmosphere.  It definitely doesn't fit the quality and beauty of the food.  But, I still give it a 5, as the food is superb.

If you are a true foodie GO. I was excited the whole meal, as I couldn't wait to see what came out next!   If you are a meat and potatoes type with an uneducated palate, save your time and money, since you won't appreciate the menu at all.",high
"Only three stars?  Wow--maybe it was the ambiance that sucks overall here--I don't know.  I actually didn't go here myself.  It was my wife.  She brought me home a cheese enchilada plate and it hit the spot--even lukewarm.

All I know is that meal was better as a leftover than a lot of the fresh ones I've had at taquerias around the tri city area.  Makes me wonder how it would taste if it were nice and hot. . .

Okay--challenge accepted.  I'll let you know.",low
"I heard good things about this place, and was looking forward to what the ""basement"" atmosphere would feel like, lowbrow, a little seedy, etc. Sadly, too many middle-aged men wearing flip flops out on a Friday night. Flip flops? UGH..in Winter? Also, our waiter SUCKED! He acted like he had a hard night and was unwilling to suggest a beer, so I am sure he spit in my draft...Anyhoo, does not matter as I will not return.",low
"I tried Pork on a Fork at the ASU Tempe farmers market. Beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches were sold there in a small tent.

My sandwich (brisket) was very tasty, albeit a little plain (just meat and bread). There were three great BBQ sauces available - sweet/mild, tart, and spicy. I used a lot of all three, but spicy was the best. I felt like I could drink those sauces!

At $6-8, the sandwiches are a little pricey, but they are filling and taste excellent. It would be nice if they came with some corn, beans, or the like to round out the meal.",high
"Ordered the mushroom burger, they put canned mushrooms on the burger. Gross! The patty melt was good. But it's really hard to mess up a patty melt. My salad had a bug in it.

Service was nice. And they do have a yummy cider beer.",low
"Love their pizza!!!
Very fresh. Their cannoli was really good too.
They seem to have great selection of wines.",high
"I had my first experience with Matt's this morning. A friend of mine had seen it on Diner's, Dives and Drive In's (or something along those lines) and was excited to try it out. The wait was about 20 minutes(arrived at 9 am) and seating is very limited but worth it!

I'm all about the breakfast food so I was excited to try somewhere new. The menu is limited but covers all bases. The coffee (a special blend just for them) is local as is everything that they serve. I swear the bacon tastes better when it's from around the corner.

I decided on the belgian waffle and a side of hash browns. SUPER YUMMY!! I appreciate the note on the menu that they only use butter and extra virgin olive oil... No trans fats here! The hash browns were a bit oily but tasty overall.

As I was leaving I saw a huge stack of pancakes on their way to a table... I know what I'm getting next time!!",high
"This was the best camera/photography store in the valley.  It has now been re-imagined and renamed as Photomart upon its move to Scottsdale.  I recently visited the new location...and I was shocked!  The store was extremely small, had very little to sell (I didn't even see a camera on display).  They did carry some glass...but mostly a very small selection of accessories.  I didn't even recognize any of the former employees.  

I encourage all the former loyal Photomark customers to visit Photomart.  I'm sure you will leave disappointed.  Two thumbs down to this lemon!",low
"Its refreshing to find one-of-a-kind places -- God knows Phoenix needs more of them to inject personality into this generic, strip-mall, chains-on-every-corner valley. Finding this unique sandwich shop, which is in a house that has been transformed into a restaurant, is indeed a welcome find. The real estate is limited, so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building.

The dining area is mainly indoors, but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot, which is not very scenic. Inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased.

They serve wraps, bowls and salads. The food has been pretty good, although it did not knock my socks off. I ordered the Baja Bowl, which is described on their online menu as ""Southwestern chicken atop garlic rice, black beans, Monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo."" It was OK, but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks. It could have possibly been microwaved -- not sure, but there were no southwest flavors to speak of. I have done a better job of cooking chicken on my George Foreman grill at home. Perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor, but I had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor. Sour cream was not ""lime"". There was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl. I would not bother ordering this again -- especially if I have a craving for some southwest food.

On another recent visit I ordered a wrap called ""Prince of Thai's - Spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach, garlic rice, fresh ginger slaw, cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla."" That had better flavor than the baja bowl. Vegetable ingredients were fresh and good. Again, I was not very impressed with the chicken chunks.

One thing I think That's A Wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups. Afterall their slogan is ""Healthy Food for a Hungry Planet"" and they have a link for a new restaurant ""Green"" for Vegan food on their website. For such an artsy, earthy place, I would have thought That's A Wrap would have made more conscious, earth-friendly choices. For that reason and the bland chicken, I give them an average rating only.",high
"The place was pretty empty - even for an off night. The service was pretty decent, but like I said - it was empty. 

I've been in here a few times, but never when it's busy. The prices don't impress me, but I'd say you get a pretty decent pour for the money. 

One thing I'd like to point out - a 1.5L bottle of Dom is less than 1000 bucks, but a 3.0L bottle of Dom is 3500. If you're a fucking idiot, get the 3L. If you're a smart shopper, you'll get two 1.5L bottles or else just by the glass - which works out even cheaper. Just so you know, it works the opposite way Costco does. If you're getting a big ass bottle of Dom anyway, you probably don't care.

The decor is red. It's very dark in here at night... dark and loungy rather than clubby. Similar to Merc Bar, but not as hip or hidden... even though they try to hide it with curtains. It's also pleasantly quiet in here... easy to have conversations. 

With the patio door open, you're going to smell cigarettes people are smoking outside if you're sitting at the bar or on the couch adjacent to there. 

It's a nice bar, but I don't know that I'd single it out as a ""place to be."" I actually think the Mondrian is pretty nice - but that's based entirely on good memories that are completely unrelated to the place and have more to do with the people I was with at the time. If someone wealthy and hip was here from out of town looking to party, the Mondrian is one of a handful of hotels I'd suggest. Not so much because of Red Bar, but more because it's conveniently located within stumbling home distance to so many other better bars in Downtown.",low
"I now consider myself an Arizonian. If you drive a lot on the 101 or 51 like I do, you'll get your fair share of chips on your windshield. You'll also have to replace a windshield like I had to do just recently. Apparently, chips and cracking windshields  is common in Arizona. In fact, I seem to recall my insurance agent telling me that insurance companies must provide this coverage in Arizona.

I had a chip repaired about a year ago near the very bottom of the windshield. Just recently a small, very fine crack started traveling north on the windshield from the repaired chip (a different vendor repaired the chip). I called these guys over to my house and they said it was too long to fix, so they replaced the whole windshield the next day.

What great service, they come out to your residence or place of business to repair or replace your windshield.",high
"I love everything at Market bistro, but I especially love the salads.  I always get the create your own with their homemade and delicious buttermilk Caesar dressing on the side.  That dressing is totally addictive!  The other thing I would wholeheartedly recommend is the Market pizza with goat cheese, artichoke hearts, oven roasted tomato, baby spinach, mozzarella, parmesan and basil pesto sauce.  It is probably my favorite vegetarian pizza.  You can get it by the slice at lunch, but have to order a whole pizza for dinner.

I've had the corn chowder with poblano chiles soup and it was great.  I've not tried the roasted garlic tomato soup but my friend loves it.  Had a sandwich here once, with tri-tip with caramelized onions, but it doesn't seem to match the description of the ones currently on the menu.  The only thing I haven't loved so far is their Margherita pizza.

Everyone here is always nice and friendly.  I love that it's family-owned and still doing well enough to open another location.  They now have online ordering, which I can't wait to try!",high
"Finally, a great Asian fusion restaurant. The service was super friendly. They even got me Yoo-zu tea because they didn't have honey. Server was great also and gave us recommendations about the amount and food choices because we asked - very professional. 

Now, the food...
- spicy wontons: mmmm deliciously fried to perfection and i absolutely love that wasabi sauce
- shumai: ehhh..though a lot of people on yelp liked it, the skin was a little hard for me
- sesame tofu: cute little deep friend tofu cubes
- shabu style miso with shrip: warm light soup, definitely a must try
- red thai curry: omygosh, that almost took off my tastebuds..i wouldn't recommend it unless you like spicy beyond jalapenos

Overall, a great experience, delicious food, nice ambiance. Oh, everything fried tasted non-greasy and rather healthy - a rare treat. :)",high
"We've eaten at Taneko twice now, and while we like it, it's awful expensive for what you get, and I prefer a more authentic Japanese environment.

Taneko starts off wanting to be a Japanese-style pub restaurant, but ends up throwing way too much Scottsdale into it creating a rather pretentious yet still yummy restaurant.

The food is excellent - I enjoy the pork meal that has the stupidly spicy mustard sauce.  My kid likes the fried rice, though it is a little too much on the ginger side.  There's a gimmicky hot-rock appetizer where you cook pieces of steak on a super hot rock.  It's way too expensive for what little meat you get, but it's an awful lot of fun.

The service is excellent as well, though maybe a little too servile for my tastes.  The wait staff go WAY out of their way to make you comfortable and quickly take care of any needs.  I just don't care for all of the introductions - I'm not going to remember the names of the 4 or 5 people bringing me stuff.  Still, I think that's the Scottsdale influence.  Not bad, but not really my thing.

Overall, I've enjoyed both of the meals that I ate at Taneko, but with better places to eat real Japanese food like Yasu, Sea Saw, Hiro's and even Sakana, I'm probably not going back real soon.",high
"My part Jewish friend has been raving about this deli so come payday we went to check it out. Ive been in Phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food here...diarrhea lots, shit my pants once... anyway, i like to eat in divey non-american cuisine. This place aint seedy enough for me, I suppose.

I did not get ill from the food here

However....

 $12.95 for a sandwich, fries, and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ???

I kept hearing from my friend, his mom and the waitress that the sandys are HUGE.
nope.

Thought we might split one.
nope.

My sandwich was flavorless..err..thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread.

$29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!). I only had $40 (only ?)

Left the waitress $5.

Gave my friend the other $5 to put toward a plane ticket to New York where he might experience Kosher (and a bit of his heritage) on a more realistic scale.

..the fries were good tho.",low
"I am always in search of good food fast...not fast food! I think Jimmy John's knows what they are doing, and should continue to knock out those sandwiches, FAST.

I love that I can pretty much know, I will a) Not wait in line and b) be in and out in 2 to 5 minutes flat! Heck yeah! And get a very tasty filling sub.

I recommend the Lulu, it is very good, and has tons of meat.

Oh, don't waste your hard earned money on the Avocado. This is my only complaint about Jimmy John's, they have pureed avocado and just spread it on like it is mayo, only they don't put much on. I think it is a waste of money.

This is my go to lunch place when I am in a hurry!",low
"Pastrami tasted good, but had a lot of tough tissue, and was near impossible to bite through. Rye bread was low-quality.

Curly fries were tasty.

Cole slaw was yummy! Really the highlight of the meal.

Lemon bar was delicious, if a bit subdued. (I like the lemon to pucker my face)

The brownie was warm and chocolatey, but too many nuts.

Probably my only visit, unless someone invites me.",low

Nothing like Home Depot, where you have to go and hunt down an employee and when you do they can't wait to get back to their break or whatever was more important than their customer.  I was just overwhelmed by the courteous and quick service I received at this location.  Even their quality of garden plants surpassed several other super stores.",high
"I've now been here twice, one to eat in and one to carry out.

All in all, great prices, decent service, and semi-good food.

I've had the pho when I sat down and ate at the restaurant.  Not the best I've had, but at the price, really good and fulfilling.

When I've carried out: had the bun thit nuon.  Great stuff. Mi xao and hu tieu xao were just ok.

I like that the whole place is very big (from a recent expansion, I'm reading). 

The bathrooms are pretty good and the service is not too typical Viet: actually friendly-ish and not too rude/brusque.

I would come back again for sure. The prices are what you would find in California, so that is just too good to pass up.",high

"I really enjoy writing reviews praising a place for great food, service, ambiance, and value, or any combination of these. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those reviews. 

This is a fish story... No, not about the big one that got away. Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water.... this is about the trout that saved the day.

When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House, it was earlier in the evening, still happy hour, though we were there for dinner not appetizers. Checked-in with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 30-45 minute wait for a table. We knew the place was popular so weren't upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner.

Went to the bar to order wine and that's when our disappointment started. We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders,  In spite of this, in the 15 minutes we waited, occasionally waving and saying ""excuse me"" to get the bartenders' attention, we never even got so much as a Hi, and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink.

I had only just told my wife I wasn't willing to wait another 15-30 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready. Our relief was short lived however.

After being seated, it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table. We ordered wine and water.

Our wine and water came NINE minutes later... a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage.

We skipped an appetizer, planning ahead for dessert, and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.

Approximately 15 minutes later, our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up... sans trout. 

When asked about the missing trout, she said it'd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up. When asked why she brought the side of fries, she said she thought we wanted them first, a leap of logic that totally escaped us. 

When our server said she could take the fries back ""to keep them warm until our trout was ready"", my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING, our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner.

Finally, a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone, our trout arrived. As I indicated in the begining, it saved the day. The fish was fresh, perfectly prepared and exceptional.

As good as the trout was however, is wasn't good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House. There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one (much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area), that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable. 

Spend your hard earned money somewhere else",low
"5 stars? Definitely!

Upon walking in, everything from the atmosphere, decor and staff was warm and inviting. We each ordered a 3 course meal, and agreed on different selections. The addition of a homemade mozzarella appetizer and an amazing dessert meant we each tasted 8 dishes that night. 8 amazingly unique and delicious dishes. 

We tasted from every section of their menu, including raw (butterfish and albacore), cooked (gnocchi and risotto), and meat (short rib and pork belly). Pretty much everything was ""my favorite,"" and a couple of glasses of Barbara complemented the meal perfectly. 

It was pretty quiet on the night we visited... if I may make a suggestion it would be to GO GO GO to Crudo. Like, now.",high
"Valet only parking, unless you want to try parking by the bank. Last two times we weren't able to. Not crazy about their cocktails (pretty weak) but the Bloody Mary was a welcome start to our Sunday brunch. It's not listed on their menu but they have gluten free options. Tried the egg bake, pretty good. The salmon and pork chile verde are delish (love the homemade cornbread). Overall, the atmosphere and food make this a great brunch or lunch time spot!",high
"Excellent service and great tasting food.  What more could you ask for?  A bit pricey, but that is to be expected with the level of quality.

The wait staff will cater to your every need and will make sure your lunch or dinner is to your liking.  

I came here for lunch on a business lunch and it was everything I expected.  I had the chicken caesar salad and it was great.

"At the ripe old age of 3, it's time for my previous review to take a siesta. Over the course of that three years, Tempe Camera's only gotten better. The selection's improved (finally finding a happy medium between film and digital), the prices are even better than they were, and I dare say service on the retail side's kickass too.

TCR is now my go-to photo supplier as a working pro. They've either got what I need or can quickly get it, they still know their stuff, and they support both local photographic education and the local photo industry. They're also the only dealer in the Valley that sells Think Thank Photo products, which are best damn professional camera bags ever.

And if you're an amateur, they've got plenty of friendly, knowledgeable staff for you too. Don't be afraid to ask for someone else; like almost anywhere, they employ people of varying personalities. There are sales staff I don't click with at TCR, but I wouldn't classify anyone as distinctly rude. (If you want that, you'll have to try B&H or Adorama.) If you need lots of hand-holding, the ASU crush probably means you'll either want to shop at off hours or go to Photomark--TCR tries, but the crowd to counter ratio just isn't favorable at peak times.

Repairs are still something they do very well at excellent prices. When I've had equipment serviced, it's been turned around quickly, relatively inexpensively, and works like brand new. Evaluation of your equipment is still free, as it should ideally be at every repair shop (but often isn't).

The lab's added a bunch of cool new services, including damn fine plexi mounting, and is doing a considerably better job with film than their old reputation for free scratches with purchase would suggest. Hundreds of frames processed with nary a scratch to be found.

Rentals I'm a little more ambivalent about.  They've thinned the herd out considerably (about half the rentals inventory has taken up residence in the used equipment case) and the selection of lighting equipment is basically unchanged, but they've got the latest Canon and Nikon bodies, and everything's well-maintained and in good shape. Rates are good for what they do have--the question's just if they have what you want.",high

Good sliders, fish was below average BUT the Wedge Fries are awesome!! The fish itself was OK, but the breading was watery as if steamed from the inside! I was totally bummed because It had a good flavor.. but was inedible! The 'Tartar' sauce was another huge hit! not a creamy sauce but liquidy with tons of Cucumber chunks... The Onion Rings are worth a try.. and they have a nice Horseradish- ranch sauce.

I went with the recommendation of the waiter and chose the salmon -- mistake.  It was dried up and had zero flavor.  The potatoes and asparagus that accompanied the dish however were cooked perfectly.  I also had the wedge salad to start, which was more like two mini-wedges.  Great presentation on the salad, but sort of strange with 1/2 a devil's  egg in the middle of the plate.  Good but strange and a little too small with the portion size.

"Oh Orange Table, what can I say about you? I am, to say the least, a regular here. Completely by default, of course, given that I work directly over this great little coffee shop. 

The food here: amazing. The coffee: the best. The atmosphere: perfect. So why only four stars? Because the service can be absolutely abysmal at times. Given, there are a few star performers here who give it their all, bust their ass, and never forget a customer's name. And Sue, the owner, really seems to genuinely care about each and every person that walks in the door. But the service is so unwaveringly slow that I am often prevented from eating here due to time constraints. Example: I once ordered a cup of soup to go-- soup, mind you, that is completely ready and cooked, just sitting in a big tureen in the back-- and it took 35 minutes. 

So, yes, the food is amazingly fresh, inventive, delectable. The prosciutto is shipped in from Italy. The bread is natural and baked locally. The chef's in the kitchen are mad geniuses, whipping up sandwiches, salads, appetizers, all completely fresh and filling. But you absolutely must have the time to wait for it. I've never had anything I didn't like!",high
"We use yelp.com anytime we are out of town and want a great place to eat. We weren't disappointed again...Ramiro's is great...generous portions, great prices, huge selection...you can even get most everything ala carte. We were visiting my parents and told them about Ramiro's. They said they have driven by many, many times...not any more! I had the biggest, best carnitas chimichanga I have ever seen. Can't wait to come back and have the taco salad. Don't drive by this place!",high
"Still a great place to eat. A little further from Los Tacos in AJ (home for me) since Los Tacos closed, i frequent here more often..

It is good.. I want to add that their green corn tamales are GREAT!  

their Green sauce seems to be a popular choice here on YELP's reviews. I like it a lot too!

I plan to order more tamales for the holidays! hurrah!",high
"Walked in during late lunch hour. Did not get acknowledged for about 5 mins. When I finally got sat down, and served my salad, I found a hair in it. Got no apology. Just a sigh firm the waitress when she took it away. You can't pay me to go back here. The waiters are rude.",low
"Monday evening at 5:30p....
The streets are empty....we walk into the bar looking for a Happy Hour beer while we wait for a Yelp event to get started a few doors down.   Noticing a couple of people on the sidewalk we expected more people inside....
*crickets chirping*  [You'd hear them if it wasn't for a few of the TVs that had their volume turned up.]  The interior was welcoming and clean...but why are we the only ones here...

The bartender was rather indifferent and sauntered over like he was wishing he could be somewhere else too.  We had a leisurely beer and tabbed out....I may have to check out this place again if I find myself in the area.",high
"Went here with some friends and the pizza was pretty good. The ricotta cheese and tomato toppings were fresh and clean and very tasty. However, what I remember is a peachy-vanilla-martini which definitely got me a little tipsy, even before I finished it! But I'm also a lightweight. 

The atmosphere was pretty casual and very well-lit. I loved their ceiling-high windows. Their service was attentive and pretty quick. 4 stars.",high
"It seems totally unbelievable that, not only did I hang out for more than an hour at a mall, but an outside one at that in 115-degree heat. I attribute my ability to withstand these two unfavorable conditions to two things:

Bonnie 
Tea Infusion 
 

It was Bonnie's choice to grab some drinks at what she described as a ""great, independently owned tea shop"" located at Tempe Marketplace. I'm not a tea connoisseur by any means, and I generally distrust fads (i.e., this silly-sounding thing called ""boba"" tea), but I agreed cause if  Bonnie likes it, it's gotta be worth checking out, right? 


Parking wasn't too much of a hassle on a Sunday afternoon, and we surprisingly got a space close to an entrance to the ""District,"" just outside of Barnes and Noble. Inside, the shop looked much like a Starbucks - and I don't mean to imply that it was uninspired or anything. It was clean, modern and consisted of a long counter behind which two employees busily hand-mixed tea and smoothie concoctions, along with a few tables/chairs. 


The menu was extensive and separated into ""black,"" ""green"" and ""white"" teas, any of which I could get hot or cold...I think. I picked the tropics white in iced form, and B got my second choice, a peach mix white. Both were pretty delicious. There was also a selection of sandwiches and snacks that I did not sample - next time. I also ran into a good friend there who was delighted by the fact that they had this mystical ""boba,"" and so ordered a Chai-type version with blueberry-sized and -shaped balls floating on the bottom, and an oversized straw to facilitate sucking them up along with the drink. I tried one boba ball and it was gelatinous and chewy - not at all like what I expected - and an odd sensation, but I would totally order one the next time I'm in. 


Being in the District and flanked by stores like ""Hottie Inc."" and Guess, there were several teens inside hanging out in large numbers - boo. So, we decided to sit outside for as long as we could stand it. I was surprised to find that the several shaded tables and misters made for a pretty comfortable environment, and we hung out for a good hour or so before I got so sweaty I have to get mobile.  


So, in summary, I would totally come back. Probably before or after a movie, to grab a drink and support an independent store among a mecca of chain retail. Plus, right across the way there is an ASU art gallery (closed Sunday and Monday) that we peeked into and actually cool, interesting sculpture art by local artist and asu instructor David Young.  


Touche, the District at Tempe Marketplace - I have to say I am impressed!",low
I come here at least 3 or 4 times a month. Best Asian food in Phoenix however it is now closed,high
"I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet....

Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  ""You can't do that.""  ""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling."" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  ""The owners don't allow it.""  ""They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.""  ""No.  You'll have to put it away.""

Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).  

A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.    

I'd kind of like the ""Restaurant Impossible"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over.",low
"A hole in the wall in South Phoenix.... 

I order: The ""Betty Boop"" - a plate with 1 waffle and 1 fried chicken breast.  Add a huge mason jar of the sweetest & reddest Koolaid (or Sweet Tea - depending on my mood) and a side of grits drowning in melted butter and I'm a happy girl.

Their Red Velvet Cake is also amazing. 

I know fried chicken and waffles seem like an odd combination but it's really interesting and satisfying - with the syrup and hot sauce for the chicken.... Yum Yum.  

It's one of my family's favorites!!!

"Recently I had the pleasure of eating at this great new Iron Chef Jose Garces restaurant. Pulling up to the front entrance to the restaurant my girlfriend and I were greeted by extremely nice doorman who valet our vehicle for us. We were a bit concerned that we were going to get wet from the rain on this day, but thanks to the valet service the hotel & restaurant provide we stayed warm and dry! Now I must say we were taken back from the decor inside the restaurant... It was spectacular!! The way the restaurant is decorated just puts a smile on your face! Also, it gives you a feel for Iron Chef Jose Garces personality which seems to be light and fun. The food is absolutely amazing!! We split the ""IGNACIO"" Nachos which have black beans, tomato, queso mixto, jalapeño, chile de arbol, and radish, and the Barbbacoa ""Costillas"" berkshire pork spare ribs, chipotle-cider mustard bbq they were tender, juicy, and delicious! We tried the House Margarita the ""Distrito"" and the white ""Mexican Sangria"" both were spectacular!! I have never heard of a white sangria before.. But WOW it was amazing! All of the employees we encountered were extremely nice, knowledgeable, and sincere. This restaurant will definitely stay on my regular to do list! Thanks to everyone who gave us a wonderful experience!!!",high
"I went to this place with my wife because it was new and we're always looking for new places to eat. We were the only two people in the place and would have thought that the owner, to make a good impression and show gratitude for what business he did have might have come by the table to ask how the food is, make small talk or anything. He sat at their front counter watching a baseball game when we got there. The waitress took our order, he went back to cook it and resumed his place at the counter to watch the game. We felt like we were putting the guy out to have to pull away and actually cook for the only two customers he had. 

As far as the food is concerned: You can grill a great burger at home with decent meat and the fixin's you want to  put on it. In other words, it wasn't anything special and certainly nothing that I would go back for. 
Bottom line: Scottsdale doesn't need another $9.00 burger place and I wish the staff could have put more effort to appreciate our patronage.",high
"I went thier on a new wave night. I dont drink so its hard to find somewhere gay that I can enjoy sober. They had bitchin 80's music and had a good guy/girl ratio.

Scuzy waiter. Scuzy manager. Overall just a bad experience. The food was pretty awful too. I don't understand how this place is so successful! The food was either waaaay over-seasoned of severely under-seasoned. A hole in the wall Chinese restaurant can produce better Chinese food. And at cheaper prices. Search around. It'll be well worth it.,high
The Phoenix Hooters is directly opposite the Sheraton Downtown hotel where I was staying. Was really hungry and didn't want to eat at the hotel so decided to give hooters a try. Hooters girls are always a nice touch. I really liked this location since there was a lot of outside seating. The food is what you expect from Hooters. I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries. It was good but then I was very hungry. Food quality was good and arrived quickly. Can't ask for anything more!! Hooters girl was also cute!! I would come back with a crowed of guy for a drink and burger. Prices are very reasonable.,high

I had the Chopped BBQ which is Turkey, Chicken, and Beef all chopped up and cooked in BBQ sauce.  It was very very tasty.  They gave me two pieces of bread to make a sandwich and with the 1/2lb order I still had more left over.  

For my side I got the Texas Cream Corn which I really enjoy.  It has great flavor and is an excellent compliment to the BBQ.  

The location has a nice patio for the great weather we are having and you can also sit inside on picnic style tables.",high

Sometimes the downside of Yelp is that you read so many great reviews for a new restaurant and you garner these very high expectations. That's what happened with St. Francis anyways. Our bartender was not friendly at all. The dessert was very good however! Hopefully next time the service will be better - sometimes you just catch people on an off night.,high
"I live in the townhomes right next to this restaurant and it still took me 4-5 months to actually try it. Absolute blasphemy as I see it now. This is a charming little place, decor outdated enough that it's sweet again, friendly servers, and man, great food. The pesto cream sauce ravioli (I believe) will blow you away. The wine glasses are filled high. Everything is great quality. Prices are medium-range, most dishes ranging from $11-18 but coming with a salad or soup and bread. This would be a great, great date night spot.",high
"I put forth that we need to institute a new standard of measurement to be used for comparing coffee shops.  Furthermore, I think that Cartel Coffee Labs should use this place as a standard for this new unit of measurement.

I have to assume it's called a ""Coffee Lab"" for a reason.  Too many coffee shops these days are retail stores, where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling, stupid names, and fancy colors.  If you look at the menu of Cartel Coffee Lab, there are a total of 13 items.  It's all about the coffee, plain and simple.

Then again, there's really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does.  The artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with.  These people can make a latte so pretty, you really won't want to drink it (until you do, then you're happy you did).  On top of that, the selection of coffee varietals is impressive.  I've only tried one, but that alone was better than anything Starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses.  Perhaps the use of the term ""Lab"" is because they've actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done.  Either way, the formula that they came up with works better than anything I've come across before.

Then again, maybe I'm being too hard on the other places.  It's not that they have an intrinsically inferior product, but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money you'd use on the place anyway...

I digress.  Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product.  If their WiFi is weak or the back corner gets dark, I honestly don't care.  Their coffee is excellent and I'll be coming back for more.",high
"Minnie and I stopped by Papago Dog Park today on a whim... 

It was a beautiful day and since she was such a good girl in the car with me and at my afternoon meeting, I wanted to reward her.  Rather than travel out of our way to go to Chaparral Dog Park (our usual dog park destination), I remembered seeing this place, specifically the fenced in / off-leash area, and we swung by.

It was just after 4pm, and there were a handful of dogs there, and more were coming the longer we stayed.  It's a lot smaller than Chaparral, and the grass is not the healthiest I've seen... Unfortunately, there were several areas that owners didn't clean up after their pooches too.  (Come on, owners, you give the rest of us a bad name!)

Anyways, we had a nice 30 minute visit... Minnie sniffed out a few other dogs from behind and then they returned the favor to her.  Don't you love how they socialize with each other?!  Too cute.

Anyways, will this become our dog park of choice? No.
Is this a viable option if you're in the area? 100%.",high

"So, clearly the musician's make the night.  Our night was not so hot.   Half of the bad that we caught wasn't worthy of stage time, the other half was.  The horn players were exceptional, the Keyboardist wasn't.  I'll stick to the facility.  The Rhythm Room is a Phoenix, classic on the music scene, or so I'm told.  This was evident when Paul Reed showed up with his horn and just joined the band on stage.  That was cool and made you feel like you were in the right place.  Beyond that, I'm can't really claim that this place is worth the time.  We'll have to try it again to confirm, yet my urge to do so isn't high right now.  The neighborhood is questionable.  The entrance is not obvious, the bar and the service are not inviting.  The music area of the building is excellent.  You sit very close to the band.  The one thing they need to fix within that is two sets of band doors would allow for a much faster setup/teardown between bands.  We waited for an hour between bands.  The Rhythm Room is missing an opportunity here, they need a comedian or something the fill the gap.  

Some fresh eyes on how this place is run could really make some simple improvements.  Just because it's a known classic doesn't mean that it can't change for the better.  The one thing they have right is that the sound is good and if they're getting good bands, then it makes for a great night.  The annoyances only become obvious when you have an hour to descern them between bands.

The musician's interaction with the crowd before and after shows is really cool.  This makes everyone involved feel like they're in the scene.",high

Keeping a high and tight well maintained was a real pain in the ass because barbers dont understand what the hell its supposed to be like.  I am sure that many of you who keep this style of haircut understand.

Any barber can sit you in a chair and cut your hair.  This guy used a razor to get skin close on the sides, and a leveler (no, I am not kidding) to make sure that the cut was even.

I have gone to at least 20 barber shops in the Phoenix, Mesa, and Tempe area.  This barber shop beats them all.

This is the BEST barber shop in Phoenix.  I have been a repeat customer for 9 years, and I will keep going back until they close up shop.",high
"Been to the Spotted Donkey in Carefree multiple times and always been happy.  (can't speak to their new location on Hayden as we haven't been there yet).  The drinks are very good, if a bit pricy and the apps are wonderful.  Ordered the short stack of nachos, stuffed peppers and enchaladas this time.  All very good and tasty.  One note, everything seemed to be a bit ""saucier"" this time, especially the nachos.  While the sauce is very good and tasty with a good amount of spice, it was a bit mcuh for me.  I don't remember it being that way before so perhaps this was a fluke.

Will definately be back",high
"We went to Ocean Prime the other night and it was delicious.  I don't know if it was worth the money but it was definitely good.  The setting is as attractive as any restaurant I can remember, with classical contemporary decor and a very cool display of alcohol bottles in the bar.

I was in a party of seven and the prevalent dish was the bone-in filet.  We had heard it was better than the steakhouses in Chicago.  Well I'm from Chicago, and trust me, you get a better (and bigger) bone-in filet at Joe's.  But it was still a delicious steak.  The sides were terrific and the salads were good too.  But those prices!  Wow, value is not this restaurant's strong suit.

About the only other thing I'll add is the service was below average, a concern considering what the prices were like.  Our server tried hard but he was too slow and didn't get our order right.",high
"U.S. Egg is situated directly across the street from Denny's.  A nicer and classier environment than Denny's but the quality of food is similar (well, slightly better) and a bit pricier.  Service here was really friendly however.

Ordered the Triple Play (pancakes, eggs, and bacon) but substituted the regular pancakes with their famous protein pancakes which are packed with oatmeal, blueberries and cinnamon.  Bacon and eggs are always good, tough to mess those up.  The protein pancakes had a nice flavor, but the oatmeal which is mixed within the batter before they are poured on to the griddle actually messes with fluffy texture that I enjoy whenever I eat pancakes.

If you are really big on breakfast and brunch food and don't want to eat at a nationwide chain restaurant it may be worth it to check this place out, just temper your expectations on the protein pancakes.",high

"*CASH AND CHECKS ONLY*
*OPEN 9 AM, 7 DAYS A WEEK*

Love this place. Took my daughter here a year ago to get her very FIRST haircut. We had Miss Tara, who provided us with a ""first haircut"" certificate and she also had these tiny quarter-size ziploc bags for my daughter's very first strand of hair that she cut. The haircut was $15. Along with the haircut, Miss Tara styled it and put clips and glitter in her hair. My daughter LOVED it. 

The place itself was kid-friendly. There's a little kitchen for the kids to play with while waiting for their haircut. There are 3 big kid chairs for older kids to get their haircut. And there are 2 car-styled chairs for the younger kids. 

I took my daughter for her SECOND haircut today. We had Miss Annette. She was great. Again, my daughter got her hair styled after her haircut and got glitter and flowers put into her hair. The haircut was $15. We also got a punchcard, where you're 9th haircut will be free. 

This place does walk-ins, but it is better to call and schedule an appointment since they don't have a specific opening/closing time. They take CASH ONLY so keep that in mind.",high
"I am not happy with the co worker who introduced me to Forefathers.  Do I really need another way to feed my addiction to cheesy, beefy goodness?  

Of course I do!

This small restaurant in a Tempe strip mall has earned a special place in my heart.  No, not just because of the artery-strengthening cheese.  It is home to the best cheesesteak I have experienced since moving to AZ.

While the menu offers a variety of choices other than cheesesteak sandwiches (chicken and even *gasp!* salads), I stick with what I know and love:

Regular with Cheez Wiz ($7.35) - bring your appetite, because this sandwich is big!  A generous portion of thinly sliced meat and that oh so important Cheez Wiz is nestled within a soft bun.  It is gooey, drippy and messy.  Perfect.  If Wiz is not for you, it is also offered with white American cheese, Provolone or Mozzarella.  While I prefer mine with just the basic meat and cheese, you healthy types can also get any combination of 'OMG' - onions, mushrooms and green peppers.

Fries are a very nice compliment to the sandwich.  Let's be honest here, fries are a very nice compliment to nearly anything.  Forefathers' fries ($2.55) are hot, salty and crisp.  If you haven't gotten your fill of Wiz on your sandwich, you can turn those fries into Cheese Fries ($2.95).  Either way, be sure to grab a container of 'fry sauce' (I am guessing this is some blend of ketchup and mayo).  One taste and you will want to put this on everything.  

Lucky for me and my cholesterol level, this gem is nowhere near where I live.",high
"I absolutely love the food here!  The sushi and Walnut Shrimp are cravings that I must give in to.  This is a nice, small restaurant that is exceptionally clean and comfortable. Good for a casual date, lunch any day (their specials are a great deal), and the owner managers are on site most hours they are open. 
You have to try the Walnut Shrimp!",high
"I just went here for the first time with my boyfriend this afternoon. I got a Green Apple Snow and he got a Mocha... Blast? or something like that. We both loved them. While the drink was amazing, what was even better was the quality of their boba, they weren't too hard or squishy and they had the perfect taste. 

The shop was really clean and nice and cool. I also noticed they had battleship and I think checkers and some other board games out for customers to play with. They also had a computer monitor I am guessing for games. I didn't go to look at it. I think there was music on but I can't remember.

The service was really fast, but then we were the only ones there. You can't use a debit/credit card for an order under $10 so we ordered an extra drink for our friend we were going to visit. We asked if she could make it when we were ready to leave and she was really nice about it. 

I can't say one bad thing about it. If I find something else on another visit I will update. As of now this is going to be my number one place to get boba.",high
"Had to go into Scottsdale yet again, this time to the quaint Scottsdale Mall.  Well went there for a reason, after seeing Jewel of the Crown on PBS ""Check Please"", I was hungry for some Indian food. 

Monday night: not busy a couple people eating out on the patio, and a large Indian family eating there, seems like they were talking about the recent demise of Bin Laden and they had their children there eating and studying, so I imagine it was all owners family.  But they weren't annoying and well behaved.  

Greeted immediately, felt welcomed and liked the look of the decor with a kind of strange old time piano music in the background, they served us some crispy, spicy rice (?) cracker with two sauces.  I really liked the taste of those.

Ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (medium heat) and we also ordered, oh what is it called, chicken something with spinach, and garlic Nan bread.

Chicken tikka masala was very nice, it came in a kind of pot that was still bubbling.  I like that, the only thing was I would have preferred more spice, so next time will go with hot and not medium.  The other dish was decent but could have used a bit more kick, but that was ordered mild so that was our error.

Great iced tea, very refreshing and they kept it filled without asking.
I wish I lived in this area, all the cool restaurants are in SCOTTSDALE!! Son of a mother, why is that the way it is?  Not fair.

Anyways, enough about me, I would definitely go back, heck I would even go out of my way from Glendale to drive over and give it another try, it was definitely above average.  The food was hot and fresh, with nice ambiance and service.",high
"With a few hours past and a few tasks accomplished the next stop of my day would be at Pane Bianco - the sandwich shop from the Valley's most celebrated Chef, Chris Bianco.  Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.

Arriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take ""any seat I wanted"" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.

Having debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive ""Grandma Slice"" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.

Moving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was ""wow - that is a lot of cheese"" while my second, after a bite, was ""wow - that is a lot of flavor.""  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.

Largely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.",high
"The person before me reviewed Phoenix Greyhound Park as a Flea Market. I....will be reviewing the Greyhound Park in Dog Race form. 

We came here during 4th of July night, after many drinks and BBQ-ing and swimming at my relatives home. Prior to leaving to come here, it sounded like a good idea - I was comparing the dog races to the Del Mar horse races in San Diego in my head.

But, during the drive, I started feeling wary. This is Arizona, and they're racing dogs in 110 degree heat? What is the constant tugging at my heartstrings? This guilt isn't working for me. 

The track is outdoor, while the patrons betting on these beautiful animals sit indoor in stadium seating, behind huge glass windows, watching giddily while drinking beer and eating snack bar-type foods. Admission is free. 

They do keep the dogs indoor before racing them. I decided I'd relent and bet on a race, then immediately felt like an asshole when they brought the dogs around for the camera and I saw them dressed in numbered garb and muzzles. I lost, but I didn't bet for the rest of the races we stayed for, it just didn't feel right.

Everyone else had a good time, though, especially the winners. 

How can I get so excited about the horse races but not the dog races? I'm a walking contradiction.",high
"This is a quick grab some decent food kind of place.. this is not by any stretch 'THE' place to go for Thai-  It's best for lunch specials... expensive-ish for dinner for what it is.  It's fine.  We go for lunch because they are AMAZINGLY fast (insert premade everything), but when we get tired of the same 'ol same 'ol we head to Thai Hut.
  We have had some instances of meals being too hot/spicy for our table, so be sure you mean spicy when you order a spicy dish.",high
"Are you serious? $4.50 for domestic beers during the usual ""happy hour"" time? That includes Old Style (we were there for the Cub game)!! At grocery stores you can get a 6-pack of Old Style for $4.50! And charging $5.50 for a Corona?! Cra-zy!

""World Famous Sliders""? These were the worst sliders ever, I think Jack and the Box sliders are better. Almost $10 for six southwestern sliders with a patty the size of a half dollar that got lost in the bun, one jalapeno, a small square of cheese, and salsa to make the bun soggy. I know they have a prime location being right outside of the ballpark and all, but does that really give them the right to charge whatever they want? They are going to make money regardless, they don't have to be greedy about it!",high
"This place is one of the ""dives in a strip mall"" that seem so popular in this state. Today was not the first time that I have eaten here but, after reading some of the negative reviews, thought I would toss in my two cents..... 

I like to go here for lunch. They are prompt and the food is the perfect amount for lunch....maybe a bit too much. I am a creature of habit. Once I find that one thing that I love, I can't help but to run comparisons to other restaurants. Erawan has 2 items on it that I have to name as Best in Phoenix......Mint Chicken and their Tom Yum Gai soup. FYI, you can not get that soup on the weekends though. 

So, in short, this place is great for lunch and can't speak about how the service is any other time.",high
"Everything is awesome at this place, and authentic according to my Japanese friend.

I just love the fact that they have more than just sushi. Their fish with rice dish was amazing. Since I've come to AZ, I've never seen this dish at any Japanese restaurants around here.

The staff is all Japanese, with somewhat limited English, so I guess you know you're at an authentic place.",high
"Cozy place, great amounts of food for little money, they serve koolaide!!!!  Its all great I loved it both times so far, once in 2003 when I went to review it for the school newspaper, and again 8 years later when I drove by it and the nostalgia made me try it again with the fiance",high
"Decent gelato.  Some real, some artificial flavors.

Comparable to Gelato Spot, I guess.

Nowhere near the same league as Arlecchino, though. However, any place that doesn't use 100% real fruit, chocolate, etc... will never compare to Arlecchino.

If you're already at Tempe Marketplace, MDG serves the purpose.",high
Great food and very friendly service.  Happy to recommend!,high
"When I left this place the bartender threw her fist up in the air and told me to go take on the world. How cool is that?

I was impressed by how clean it was inside.  Plus they have craft beer on tap for $3.  Need I say more?",high
"This is my favorite breakfast & lunch place in Ahwatukee. The food is excellent. The service is friendly and they do what they do perfectly. This isn't a place to go for elegant sit down service. It's the perfect blend of self-service meets top restaurant quality food. 

Have the Croque Monsieur--or add an egg to make it a Croque Madame. You will not be disappointed. The bread and the baked goods are so good you could make a substantial meal off them alone.

Finally, this is a small local business that truly cares about its community. They have shown up at two community fund raising events with huge boxes of warm, freshly baked cookies to donate. I'm grateful to have a place of this caliber in my neighborhood.",high
"I was impressed with this place. I had the Mongolian Lamb and an Asahi beer. It totaled $14.00 before tip which I thought was reasonable for dinner and especially for a lamb dish. The portions were very generous and even though I was starving when I stopped in, I ended up only eating about half of the meal before getting full. It was delicious. Tender lamb and a great sauce.

The waiter was very polite and helpful and the food came out pretty quickly. It was very comfortable inside and the decor was tasteful. I did not expect that one of the best Chinese restaurants (of course in my opinion) would be located in Avondale. I feel bad for frequenting the Pei Wei on Dysart and McDowell so often when a non-chain place of this caliber is right up the road.",high
"There're times when you eat something and you want more. Then there are times when you eat something and you instantly know you will never have anything quite like it. For me, I experienced both of those at Pizzeria Bianco. My buddy and I drove almost 500 miles from Santa Barbara for a Giants-Diamondbacks game and thought we'd try this place I had heard about. We arrived fairly late so there was about a one hour wait but man, was it worth it. We ordered a Biancoverde and a Wiseguy. I was a bit skeptical at first because they each didn't have tomato sauce like I was used to, but I realized I dont care much for tomato sauce in the first place and I'm always up for trying new things. BEST DECISION OF THE DAY. The Biancoverde was my favorite. It was so simple (3 cheeses, arugula, and olive oil) yet so amazing. It has left me wanting more to this day. The staff was nice and friendly, not to mention a few cuties. I will definitely drive 500 miles for it again. In fact, I'll be making my way to Phoenix in a few weeks, JUST for the pizza!",high
"I first visited this restaurant after my friend pushed me to visit the Hawaiian festival at the Tempe Town Lake a few months ago.

""Big deal,"" I thought. ""How can a Hawaiian festival be fun?""

Well, the food was amazing. And after having half a rotisserie chicken, I was craving for more.

A few days later, I finally began my search for the perfect (or near perfect) Hawaiian restaurant, in which I can satisfy my Hawaiian cravings.

My first stop was Mai Island Grill, located in/near the Arizona State University campus. Parking was a bit of a challenge; this is especially true during the lunch hour.

When I finally found a parking spot, I went in and ordered. I had the short ribs plate. The plates include one scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice.

After placing my order for the short ribs, I ordered the Spam musubi.

The guy preparing food replied with a laugh.

""Is it good?"" I asked

Jay -- the man who operates this restaurant -- replied, ""Yes it's good."" 

Then he said something about how the guy who laughs never laughs (or something like that).

About 10 minutes later, my food was ready.

The food was fantastic; just what I was looking for!

The prices are very reasonable. Plates are about $10 and less.

I also suggest that you try the fish, beef, grilled chicken, and pork katsu.

And finally, I hope that this place continues to provide the same liberal portions. Also, I think it would be cool if Mai Island Grill began serving two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice (just a fantasy of mine).

Additional Notes:

- Cash Only.

- Opens late in the morning and closes early in the afternoon (call for exact hours).

- There never seems to be any ""Lumpia!"" :-/",high
"This is the king of asian buffets! The price is a little high but its worth it. This is one of the few buffets were everything you try and put on your plate is good. Service was excellent well, especially for a buffet. 

P.S.=You better watch out for me in the lines cuz I'm ruthless when I get in buffet mode.",high
I really enjoy this place and have eaten there several times. They just recently changed their menu but I like the brew additions. The coconut shrimp are awesome and the ahi tuna salad is to for for!  I did have the chimichurri flank steak sliders but they weren't good. Our waitress was great and offered me something else.,low
"Why did I stop coming going to Pro Ten Nail Shop? They are located very close to where I work and I used to go to this shop all the time, they do a great job on pedicures! I got what would be called a deluxe pedicure with designs on my toes for only $27 bucks!!! Can you believe that!! They have signs all over asking for the customer's to pay in cash, that why they can offer us the lower prices! I am more than ok with paying in cash and my toes are looking cute! I think I am on my way to becoming a regular again for sure!",high
"I don't know what Bar Smith is trying to be. I feel like instead of just saying okay we are going to be a X music club on Saturday night they decided to try and appease too many people. 90s R&B and Hip hop on the first floor Techno Electronica on the roof top bar. 

oooooKAY.

I visited the during the 4th Annual Pub crawl at 11:30 at night the place was still pretty empty. 

Drinks-Meh
Crowd-Meh, I am still trying to find the young professional males in this area.
Layout- I like it
Bouncers-Really big and Super nice but then again I smiled a lot and didn't give them a hard time about my ID. 

The last 2 is what gives it the A-Okay and not a full out Meh. I could see throwing a party there, people love dancing outside and on rooftops. This has both and the first floor DJ was decent, all things considered. 

I will give this place another chance. 

Maybe it can redeem itself up to 4 stars.",high
"This has always been our favorite local Chinese take out - and especially on Chinese New Year, the special menu.  OMG its good.  We always call for takeout, one or two items and we are so close that by the time I get in the car and drive there, its done...less than five minutes.  

This place gets very busy, and if you get a chance, try out their Peking Duck, Hong Kong style.  Soooo delicious!

Another favorite is the snow pea leaves (not on the menu!!!  cost extra), and the Seafood Bean Curd Soup.  I love the soup here, so many delicious morsels, you can't go wrong with it ever.",high
"Wound up at Rock Bottom by chance had been wanting Carrabbas all day, due to being brain washed by commercials on TV so that when a friend said lets go out for dinner I was all gun ho to say Carrabbas, then he said Im in the mood for steak I tossed the pasta idea out the window and said Bring on the beef,  plus never been to Rock Bottom so I was thrilled at being able to try a new place! It was a Sunday night and the place was simi empty, which was nice. Service was fast and friendly and I liked the overall vibe of the place. I ordered the Texas Fire Steak which was top sirloin seasoned with crazy peper and smoking jalapeno butter, man it was delish!! Even the veggies were good!  Looking forward to another trip there to try out some more the menu!",high
"Food was amazing but the service was horrible! I would suggest to take out don't dine in. I ordered the eggs Benedict, instead of Canadian bacon, they put crispy bacon on it served it with hash browns and a salad with a balsamic vinegarette. 

The two girl working there were so unprofessional from their interaction to the attire.",high
"5 stars isnt enough!!! I love the whole Briggs family. I have been going to this dentist since I was 8 years old and they have always been so amazing to me. I love that I walk in the door and they make me feel right at home. They are so sweet and everything in that place is actually super comforting.

They use the most high tech things I have ever seen, and its good to know I'm getting A+ care for my pearly whites. I recommend them to everyone I know!",high
"Can not say enough good about this place.  I love it.  I love it!  I simply love it!  We have always had really great service and the food!  Well, the chips are thin and salty yumness and I love the salsa.  They keep you filled up and aren't like other places which try to ignore an empty container!

Number 16 Combo is my guilty pleasure!  I have had it many times the way it's intended:  Chicken enchiladas with red sauce...but lately I've been getting it with Fundito sauce and I've gotta tell you:  I'm hooked!  Try it........it's a little more $$$ but SO worth it!

I haven't had desert since I'm gluten free but the size of the fried ice cream is Gigantic.  My daughter swears by it!

Man, I wish they were open right now...cravings have begun anew....",high
"I really like this place. There aren't that many lanes, so if you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday night, call ahead and reserve your lane. 
This place has a lounge area with a good sized bar and couch area. Over where the 10 lanes are, there are about 4 pool tables, another bar, and another table and couches area. The end of the lanes have screens above them to watch sports or music videos. They play good music very loud. I had a really great time. 
My only complaint, we reserved lanes for 4 hours, and when the 4 hours was up, they wanted us out immediately. They started bussing the tables just taking drinks away. I was busy changing my shoes and didn't notice the busboy grabbed my drink. Excuse me, I just purchased that. I let him know that I understood they wanted us gone, but should ask the person sitting there which drink is theirs before throwing it away. As we were leaving, I was at the other table in our area and the busboy asks me if any of the drinks on that table were mine. I reminded him that he threw mine away and he should probably be asking that question to somebody else. It really annoyed me. 
I would definitely recommend it for a Sunday fun day. I didn't feel like we could really relax and have a good time on a Saturday because it was too busy and the staff was looking to make money rather than have their guests entertained.",high
The tuna sandwich is fabulous!!! Definitely visit this place!!,high
This place wasn't that great for the price.  I spent 15 on 2 mini grilled cheese sliders and a tea (basically bar food over priced) Not much to choose from on the menu plus portion size didn't equal out to what I paid for.   The crowd is very Scottsdale and the staff wasn't that friendly.  Definitely wont go back here again.,high
"We tried this place after reading most of the reviews.  I had rice noodle soup w/ fishballs, squid, shrimp & veggies and hubby had shredded pork sandwich.   Both were good and plenty of food.  The pork sandwich was so cheap, it was hard to believe it wasn't a typo.  Beats a Subway anyday!  The neighborhood is a bit shady but if you don't mind that, it is fine.  Service was quick and we will definitely revisit this place.  People kept pouring in during the dinner hours.  Can't beat the price!",high
"You know what the 'bucks are all about, get a Venti for the long flight you won't regret it!",high
"Let's see.....
89 cents at Taco Bell for a taco that has cheese like sprinkles on a cupcake, or a Baja soft taco that has FIVE pieces of tomato in it? 

YOU
MUST
BE
JOKING.

Compare your Baja soft taco to the picture sometime and feel free to yell at the counterperson. Yes this happened. Taco Bell should be sued for complete misprepresentation!!

MEANWHILE at Del Taco..... 

39 cents for a balanced taco with a decent amount of cheese and delicious medium (""Scorcho"") sauce --- THE CHOICE IS CLEAR. Plus the deluxe tacos are CHOCK FULL. I usually get 4 regular tacos and end with 2 deluxe ones.
I've had the double cheeseburger once, nothing impressive there. It wants to be an In 'n' Out Double-Double, but it falls short, like when you were a kid and wanted Levi's 505's for Christmas and end up getting Sears jeans.
Come for the cheap tacos and LOAD UP I SAY!
The burritos are OK too.",high
"The building itself has that Frank Lloyd Wright 70s vibe going on...not my taste, but our City isn't very old so I can live with this minor aesthetic annoyance.  (Remember when they almost tore the Orpheum down? Not cool. Fight to keep history here folks...)

Anyway, anytime I hear people begrudgingly ask ""What is there to do in Phoenix?""  I would have to suggest: We do have culture here, if you're willing to venture outside of your comfort zone and outside of the suburbs. 

Phoenix is privileged enough to have an Opera Company and Ballet Company who are great at what they do. I saw the Nutcracker most recently and GOODNESS, they all had impressive resumes.  The conductor, and costume designer were definitely stand outs.  

As audience members we are supremely lucky because the venue itself is small enough to ensure you will have a fantastic seat no matter where you are.

I will go back. I can't wait to go back. My soul craves this, as should yours.",high
"This is a great Thai food restaurant. My husband and I have been here a few times and have been very pleased with the food, as well as the service. We usually order a few curries and of course the pad Thai. The food is always consistently good. Good Thai food is sometimes hard to find, you definitely won't be disappointed here.",high
"I was disappointed too.  I waited an hour and then took at seat at the counter which is ok with me, but if you've got long legs your only option is to sit spread-eagled in order to get close enough to your plate and there's not that much legroom to each side.  In the small space in front of the counter the staff was in perpetual motion squeezing past each other to get drinks, etc.   My cheddar, jalepeno, sausage omelette was very good, but not huge, and the hash browns were crisp and tasty on the outside but soggy on the inside.  The whole wheat toast was great, but no choice of toppings...I was given a small dollop of peach preserves. 
The waffles next to me looked fabulous, but I'm not a fan.   Basically I didn't think it wasn't worth the hour wait in 100 degrees and I was relieved to get outside where there was some breathing room.",high
"I went here with a party of 4 on Saturday night and it was surprisingly dead.  Not that that's a bad thing because I don't like crowds.  The place is pretty sheik but you still feel like you're in a hotel.  Service was fast and friendly but I think it was our waiter's first night or something.  He was very awkward but it was ok.

I was pissed we couldn't get the happy hour menu/prices in the main dining room.  I know it is common practice for crowded places full of douchebags, but the bar and the main dining room were pretty empty so wtf?

I'm a vodka guy and their vodka menu is pretty neat.  They have 8 or 9 unique vodkas from around the US and clearly list their name, where they are from and the price.  What I didn't like was their martinis.  Pretty much the worst I've ever had anywhere.  Tiny pours and full of ice chips.  It was like a vodka slushy (oh snap I think I just invented something!!!).

Here is a rundown of the food:

* bread to start - excellent...love the lightly buttered and salted top
* tomato and mozzarella salad - excellent - one of the best i've ever had.  great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella.
* pretzel fondue - the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno.  the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that I love on pretzels.
* burger - pretty solid but nothing special
* mac n' cheese with Shriner's sausage - very unique and very tasty.  it was worth having once but I wouldn't get it again.
* tater tots - perfectly cooked.  salty/crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup.

The main dishes of the other people in my party looked excellent.  I should have been more adventurous and gone with something more than a standard burger.  Maybe next time. 

I was going to give this place 3 stars but I just can't.  They try to think out of the box to create dishes that are unique, have fresh ingredients, and have a local twist.  I will return.",high
"Lunchtime out with a relative on a weekday, and La Condesa has a seat by the window. There is really nothing like its saloon-artsy walls for us to gaze.   The Dia De los Muertos motif and wooden furniture make it perfect for easy conversation.  
Most folks seated around us already know where to go for lunch that's not too pricey and homemade.  
The Horchata is nothing short of liquid dessert, filled with pecans, fruit and rice milk.  You can avoid dairy all together with this and a special bullet burro with guac and lettuce.
The salsa bar sets the standard for good restaurants.  It's wide variety of salsas leave little doubt what creative people run the place.  My hope is that only a few people read this and try it. Otherwise, to my chagrin, the next time we park on 16th Street, we may have to WAIT in a line outside.",high
There are definitely better places to go to in Old Town. Overall Martini Ranch is usually pretty slow and charge a cover to get into an empty place. Last time I went there my friend and I got our cover back because it was so dead. They do have good martinis though.,high
"I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday night/Saturday morning after seeing a show at the Tempe Improv.

I came in around midnight and the place was not that busy. The waitress was pretty nice (did everything expected for a waitress) and the guy who I thought was the manager was easy to talk to. However, those are the only two good things I can say about the restaurant.

I ordered the BBQ wings and they were TERRIBLE. The flavor was very bland and half cold. The blue cheese I ordered was quite watery as well.

I also sat by the kitchen and noticed that a guy in the back was washing a stool in a sink near where the food was made. Needless to say, I won't be eating at Hooters anytime soon.",low
"We showed up out of the blue on Valentine's night looking for food. We got a seat at the sushi bar right away, but the place was otherwise packed. I guess we were lucky. We passed on the V-day prix-fixe menu and decided to order as we ate.

Our waitress was visibly perturbed by my wife's order of tap water to drink and vegetable tempura to start. Judging by her expression, she took us for deadbeats; it wasn't offensive but hilarious, we're old enough to be confident in our own opinions of ourselves. Anyway, the vibe at the W was definitely people trying hard to be cool and of-the-moment.

In any event, we struck up a conversation with the chef behind the bar where we were sitting. We initially ordered some basic sashimi dishes, but when I asked the chef for suggestions, he started rattling off a series of custom creations he could make. So we let him do his best, and he turned out a great collection of sashimi dishes, none, at least as far as I could tell, on the menu. 

We had a great meal, and we would definitely return, at least if we didn't live in San Diego.

(The waitress eventually warmed up, probably thawing as she watched us eat through plate after plate of sashimi....)",high
"This place isn't bad. The place is pretty big in size and I love that they have a drive-thru. I like coming here on the weekends, especially when I need to study, particularly in the vault. Some times they have live music, which can be good or bad, depending on if you're there to study or hang out. They have decent coffee, not the best, but not awful. And I'd prefer to go here over Starbucks any day.",high
"The hubs and I stroll through the indoor market when we are down at the farmer's market on the weekends.  They seem to have a good assortment of items, though the prices are quite high.  But I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt because they are a local business.  

One morning we were at the farmer's market and decided to grab something for breakfast - its never a good idea to shop hungry :).  I got in line for coffee while the hubs ordered breakfast.  The coffee is fabulous!  I like my food simple - so when the hubs came back with an egg and cheese I wasn't looking for anything fancy (eggs, cheese, maybe a little butter, salt and pepper on some sort of bread product).  I quickly found out that this was some sort of a hipster egg and cheese. Lettuce on an egg and cheese?  Who does that?  There were also tomatoes, mustard and assorted spices.  I'm willing to admit that maybe its just me and my underdeveloped ""simple"" palette.  So if you are a hipster and you're hankering for an egg and cheese - this is your place. Regardless, be sure to get a cup of coffee, its awesome!",high
"I went to Pei Wei last night for a casual girls' night dinner.  It was a perfect place for a group of girls to meet because of the following:

-it's cheap
-it's fast casual so each person pays their own bill and then sits down (no stress when the bill comes as is often the case with groups)
-there is plenty to choose from on the menu
-for those that are picky or dieting, they are great about special orders, sauce on the side, etc...

That being said, Pei Wei is just average in my eyes; never my first choice of places to go, but I can always find something to eat... Last night I had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice.  The shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer (probably because it did), but the veggies, rice, and sauce were all pretty good.  I noticed they changed the menu a bit since my last visit, and a new 'special' is a Vietnamese Noodle Bowl - Pho type dish.  The chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever.

I'm sure I'll be back to Pei Wei because of the positive factors listed above - the concept is a good one, just don't compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is!

PS - shout out to all the girls that came out last night - I had fun seeing all of you and can't wait for the next one!",high
"I can only vouch for the chicken salad, as it's the only thing I've ever tried in the 20 years I've been coming here. It's THAT good. I always think about trying something else, but why mess with perfection?

Walking inside gives you the sense that you've stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late 70's. I, personally, find it to be awesome. Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare. And yes, the late 70s is historic by Scottsdale standards. Besides, whatever money they're not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad.",high
"I have been going to Cartel for a while, and their coffee has absolutely spoiled me. I can hardly drink coffee or esspresso from anywhere else, I even buy their beans and brew it at home.
Most of the bartista's are stellar, but expect to wait for your specialty drinks, not only because they are almost always busy, but also because making kick ass coffee drinks takes time.
I suggest either the Honduras with cream, an iced agave latter, or a cappuccino (which you have to drink there).",high
Great great happy hour! Fun atmosphere! Great decor and best garlic edamame in the valley!,high
"If you want a deal for your buck, this is the place to go! You'll find Dewalt, Makita, Oster, Cuisinart, Farberware, Keurig, and many other banded items for a fraction of the original retail price. Yes, some items will be out the package, missing a manual, or may have a scratch or a dent but I rather pay a fraction of the price versus paying full retail at a department store. I rather save money and get a ridiculous deal for the same exact item I would have paid 10X more at a well organized and clean shop. From what I know this store has been open for nearly ten years; the owners are one of the nicest people I've met; they even offer free delivery with the furniture or any other large item you purchase. Stop by!! You'll get a kick from just walking down the unorganized, messy aisles; but once you get to the register to pay- you'll be happy!! ""Get more for less!""",high
"One of the best local places to get your booze!

BevMo has nothing on the charm, history, and liquor selection of a place like this! I am not into most beers or wines (of which they have plenty), rather I like to sample the odd/exotic Vodkas, Rums, and Tequillas.

Sportmans is a good value, but certainly not discount -it is so worth the better exprience tho- This is a store to browse, ask questions and take your time exploring.

Give Sportsmans a shot - and you'll say ""No Mo BevMo!""",high
"I've come here too many times to count during my time at ASU.  Each time I've frequented this place, I've pretty much inhaled whatever sandwich I got.  I like the fact that you can customize your sandwich to order and I really like the fact that you get a little chocolate chip cookie for free with your order!  (Their jumbo cookies are pretty darn good too!)  Avoid this place during the lunch rush, as the queue can literally snake outside and around the building.  Prices may seem on the high side for ""just"" a sandwich, but the ingredients are fresh and the people behind the counter are generally cool.  

Now....to work on using non-styrofoam cups....let's make this place even better and greener!",high
"This is my second time trying this place. My first time was a week after they opened and the pulled pork was very fatty and greasy and the fries were awful. I figured now that they had sometime to work out the kinks I would try it again. 

I ordered the deviled eggs to start these were pretty good, I would order them again.

I then ordered The Southwest sandwich. The bun was rock hard and just crumbled so I just took it off. The sandwich was supposed to come with a spicy chipotle ranch that I never got. 

I ordered a side of mac and cheese and it was cold in spots. When my server finally came to check on and acknowledge me after dropping off my food, I asked her if the kitchen could just heat it up a little. This took over ten minutes.

Without my asking they comped my $4 the price of the macaroni. 

All in all the service was pretty lousy, especially when the server only has three other tables and there is more than enough staff on. The food was not worth the price. I don't think I will be going back.
I will however continue to go to Copper Star which I love.",high
"Very good food served quickly.  Add a little hot sauce and some soy sauce, mix it together.  Eat.

Price is low and quality is high.  You really can't ask more than that.",high
"On top of how good the food is, their customer service is excellent. I went to eat there on Thursday (the 16th), and had the best server ever. He was the bartender as well, and still payed tons of attention to my table. He was very nice, and very helpful. He had extensive knowledge of the menu. He was also very personable. He laid out samples of their various barbeque sauces while giving some details about each one. He squirted them out onto an extra plate he brought to the table, and he made the shape of a smiley face with all the sauces. He made that dining experience so good that I wish I could write a review about him personally and suggest to his managers that he get a raise! I couldn't hear him when he stated his name over a large group that had just come in and was moving tables, but he was wonderful.
  Also, one of the people with me is from the east coast, and likes vinegar-based barbeque sauce. They didn't have any of that kind in their current rotation of sauces, and he actually went back to the kitchen and explained the situation. A lady from the kitchen made a vinegar-based barbeque sauce from scratch just because one of us had mentioned how much we loved it.
   I've never experienced service like that, and really can't say enough about how great this guy, and all other staff I came into contact with, was! Great job to whoever hired him.
  The food was delicious, I love their fries! Unlike anything you can get anywhere else. I got the country roasted chicken- great seasoning, super moist and tender, while still having that chargrilled/roasted skin (my favorite). All of their sauces are so good; it's hard to choose just one! (And no matter how many times I go there, I always sample each one again).
  All positive things to say about this Famous Daves!
Oh- and I forgot to mention the corn muffins...beyond words! Seriously, you have to try them. Now I'm craving one, and I'm pretty sure they're not open at 3:00 a.m. I wish I could order them by the dozen haha",high
"Doc and Edwards has been a place of refuge for 5 years for me.  Hell, most of my friends spent their 21st birthday there.  It is hard to explain walking into a bar and just feeling at home.  It is so comfortable and wide open.  Even on the most crowded days, I feel like I am on the cast of cheers.  The employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect.  You can also order silvermine there with no delivery charge!  The pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks, they waive the pool table fee. Or you could go for some ping pong, foosball, UFC, or big buck hunting.  It has a great juke box but watch out for the lady that throws 20 in and slangs the worst playlist I have ever heard. If my girl would only let me, I would have my wedding there.",high
"I can't believe some of the things I've been seeing people NAG about in their reviews for this new restaurant! I set my standards pretty high for Rice Paper and they did not disappoint! 

I took my wife on a date here last night because she really loves beef pho, and had been waiting for this place to open up! The atmosphere was very bright and welcoming, as well was our server! He sat down with us and quickly went over what was good and what was popular with most patrons so far. We took him up on a few of his suggestions and started with the fried calamari. I'm not sure what they bread it with but it was delicious, and the squid was perfect; not too soft, not too chewy!

For our main course I ordered the Shaking Beef, which was cubed filet mignon served over onions on a sizzling platter in a special sauce, with a side of rice and grilled zuchinni... again on the suggestion of my server! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! My wife got the beef pho... at first I was a bit iffy on it because the broth looked very clear as if it were going to be somewhat watery... but it was VERY well seasoned! Our server told us that the broth stews for at least 12 hours allowing it to achieve the best flavor from the pho spices! VERY IMPRESSED! 

Yes, it is much pricier than your average pho joint, but I'd rather pay a bit extra for a nice, clean and slightly upscale atmosphere! And the quality of the food is MUCH higher than the mystery meat you'll get in your bowl of pho at some other places! 

Well done Rice Paper, we WILL be back!",high
"I get a call on Thursday: ""Dude, I just got fired from UOP, we have to celebrate!"" If it was from anyone else but Ryan, I would have been shocked. However, he hated his job and we love Yard House, so I was definitely down to have some ""FU UOP"" drinks up at Desert Ridge.

Yard House has been one of our main spots for years. Right off the bat, the Happy Hour is fantastic; 100+ beers on tap, including some of AZ's finest and a couple amazing international brews. The servers usually do a great job of suggesting drinks as well. Traditionally I ""cleanse the palate"" with a Warsteiner Pilsner and roll from there. Friday night, I tipped back a few Kiltlifters as well, all brought in well frosted pint glasses.

The food has been pretty fantastic across the board. Personally, you can't go wrong with Firecracker Wings (sweet and very spicy wings) and the Spinach Dip. Their seared ahi appetizer and Caesar salad are both fantastic, with the ahi always perfectly cooked. The Southern Fried Chicken Breast is likely the best meal, though my pal is a huge fan of the Cuban Dip.

The one potential drawback is the service isn't always fast. Honestly, if you are going to relax and enjoy time with your friends, it's great. Beer glasses don't stay empty too long, waters get refilled (we only sit on the patio), and the food usually comes out before you get too hungry. Just understand that the joint gets busy for happy hour and you will enjoy the experience. Give me a call if you ever want to share some FU beers!",low
"""Buy Local Coffee"" is what a sign out front of this establishment says.  So that's what I did.  I went to Copper Star Coffee to get my drink of choice, an iced coffee with cream.  I enjoyed the flavor.  It was better than Starbucks and quite a few cents cheaper.  SCORE!!!  I became a regular.  I stuck with my ice coffee for months but their bakecase was calling my name every time I would enter.  I found out Copper Star bakes their own pastries fresh daily.  Another SCORE!!!  No preservatives or high fructose corn syrup.  I started adding a scone with my iced coffee.  They have chocolate chip, lemon, blueberry, etc.  Delicious!!!  The apple sauce spice cake is now my favorite.  It is a vegan pastry.  It is flavorful and the glaze is so slight but fantastic.  Not a vegan by the way.  

I have been slowly branching out among the Copper Star menu.  Try the Black Cherry Limeade.  The specialty coffee drinks are quite good too.  The blended toffee drink rocks.  The antioxidant smoothie is refreshing.  The other smoothies are okay.  They use syrup in those.  I don't know how healthy that makes them.  (Real fruit please).

Let's talk about their sandwiches now shall we.  I have tried their sesame tuna, the curry chicken, the deviled egg salad, and the veggie.  All of them are winners.  You wont be disappointed.  Copper Star just unveiled there new sub sandwiches as well.  They use a local butcher's sausages for their subs.  Awesome.  Way to keep it in the community.

-internet access
-community board
-art work
-misters for the heat
-water bowl for dogs
-drive thru car hop service
-frequent customer stamp card

The Copper Star building is an old service station cleverly gutted out and made super cool.  The staff is great and they stick around.  Not a high turn over.  It must be a great place to work.

Parking can be tricky.  The majority of the parking is on the street and the parked customer cars creep into the surrounding neighborhood.  You may have a little walk.  Big Woop!

A must.  Check it out.",high
"What a great little find especially for Phoenix!  I've been there on at least 4 occasions and have never been disappointed and just had to let everybody know about this little gem!  Recently  I took my mother and we had delicious Singapore Noodles and Malaysian Rice Noodles (which are kind of like Thai's Rad Na but better).  On another occasion my husband ordered Pork Belly Curry and really loved it.  I wasn't as adventurous and had delicious Chicken Kebab Burmese style.  Family owned, quiet, and very affordable.  You have to really look for this place since its in a shopping center(its on the north side of Shea between 70th & 71st St in Scottsdale). Great early bird dinners as well!",high
"I love me some coffee. The french roast brew is perfect for surviving a long day of work. If you want something sweet, order the iced raspberry mocha. Just the right amount of sweetness without tasting like you're drinking syrup. The muffins are moist and delicious. The spinach salad here is surprisingly amazing (yes, they make spinach salad at this coffee place). The best part about this place? It is not full of hipsters and college students who hog all the decent seating and never leave. I can't wait to go back to try all of the other drinks offered.",high
"So we finally decided to give Cibo another chance and I'm so glad we did!

I love love love their patio. It's very cute and romantic especially with all the lights wrapped around the trees. The heaters keep you warm on a chilly night and it's much quieter than their indoor space. This place is a great date spot. 

We both had the Prosciutto Cruda pizza and had wanted to try the burrata, but unfortunately they'd been out of it for the last week so we ordered the bruschetta instead. Our waiter also recommended the Valpolicella Ripasso, which was ok, but it was a little light for our tastes. The pizza was really good (the fresh ingredients really come through), but we weren't the biggest fans of the crust. I like something more substantial and airy. But  for a thin crust pizza it wasn't soggy at all. A big plus! The bruschetta was also ok (don't get me wrong I still ate all of it and would order it again), but each bite just needs a little more of a punch. 

Service was great and we met Karen, the owner, before we left and she is a doll. We had a much better experience this time around and we will certainly be back.",high
"So-so Mexican food.  I have heard people raving about this place and I don't really get it.  Don't get me wrong, it's better than Manuel's or Filiberto's... but that's about all I can say.

Okay, their Pollo Fundido is good (but not great like you will get at Ajo Al's). But let's talk about the purple and teal accent colors that scream ""I was remodeled in the 80's""! Lame.

Good chips and salsa but small-ass bowls! 

Oh, and don't expect to park in their little lot during dinner rush.  Also, the surrounding neighborhood is definatly the ghetto-side of the Moon Valley area.",high

"Being a San Jose native, I know Pho and Vietnamese cuisine. Let me tell you, Khai Hoan is excellent.  Definitely the best I have had in AZ and comparable to the best noodle houses in San Jose.  

The pho (rice noodle soup) is great- beef or chicken.  The dry noodles and rice dishes are generous portions, and very tasty.  Great ingredients in everything.  Make sure you get an order of spring rolls.  . .   

If you have not had Vietnamese food, check it out!  It is fantastic.  If you have had Vietnamese, go to Khai Hoan and you will not be disappointed.",low

"Arai pastry is so delicious!
ironically i come here not for the sweeties: confections, cakes, cookies, cremes, not being my style- but for their delicious savory treats! The breads they make here are top knotch, the various salty pastries are all worth exploring, the red bean one and the curry filled ones being my favorites. But the real deal, the Coup de grâce, the mamoth reason of what makes this little japanese pastry shop (in my mind) is their sandwhiches/ green tea shakes
that powerful one two punch of savory sagacity is what makes me want to live sometimes

"I ADORE this place. Matt's has been a staple breakfast, brunch, whatever place for me since I moved to Downtown 5 years ago. They just moved to a great place up the street (where Verde used to be for locals) with more room so now everything isn't so crammed! Not that we all didn't enjoy their original house, this one just says, ""I'm still awesome, I just stepped up a notch."" Everything is delicious. I love their 5 Spot, the waffles are great, and their lunch specials are always amazing. If you like jelly - try their homemade stuff. Try the bacon.",high
"I really like this place. However it does suck time like no other place.

Somehow evertime you are there for over 2 hrs?

I usually try on 60 items to get 1 that fits well, and cry a half dozen times about being fat :(

Then I cruise the little kids clothes because the mens clothes are to large for me and the womens are cut weird.

One of my boobs is like a 3rd the size of the other so its soo hard to find clothes that dont make me look like a cancer survivor.

Anyway, good finds here. Try the clothes on even if it says the size is smaller than you wear. A lot of times it says one size but is really another.
My girlfriend bought 200.00 jeans for 20.00 a piece because it said they were a 24 when they were really a 27.


P.S. anyone know where to find some dress vests?

The womens ones are too short and make me look like I have flowing love handles and the mens vests are to big in the shoulders and ribs.

I think I should try maybe a kids vest? thoughts?",high
"I have to admit, I love a good Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches...So when I heard about this place I had  try it.  We made the drive down there...park in the parking garage off of 5th st.  Walked to the resturant and was pretty impressed.  Place was really clean, guys behind the counter were as nice as philly people can be.  Then I looked at the menu, saw what I wanted to order and ordered it.  I ordered an full size cheesesteak with cheese wiz...i made it a combo.  I was shocked that it came out to like $13 for a sandwich, drink and fries.  When I finally got my food, I was impressed with the taste but don't know if it's worth the $13 I paid for it.  If you don't want the combo, the full sandwich is still $9.  So if you want a good sandwich, be prepared to friggin pay for it.",high
"3 1/2 Stars.

Girl's choice last night.... and we (my sister, my niece Carol, and myself) ended up at the Famous Dave's in Chandler. These Famous Dave's look like every other one... typically bright Orange and Yellow! At night, you must have deficient eyesight if you can't find a Famous Dave's! In the evening, Famous Dave's is just a lighthouse beacon in the middle of a drab mall!

On the menu...

Blue Margarita (** 1/2) made with Blue Curacao - It's disconcerting when the last time you saw your niece she was just drinking Cokes... now it's Blue Margaritas. Must be getting old. In summary... not very toxic. Could have drank this in one gulp and wouldn't have had an effect! Machine mixed and made. Looked cool, though, with an Aquamarine Blue color.

All American BBQ Feast (****) Gimmick is that all this stuff ( Full Slab of St Louis style SpareRibs (*****), Whole BBQ Chicken (*** 1/2), 1/2 lb of Texas Beef Brisket (*****), Famous Fries (*****), 2 Baked Potatoes with all the Fixin's (*****) replaced the Coleslaw and Wilbur Beans, 4 Corn on the Cob (***), 4 Muffin Style Corn Bread (****) ) is served on a bright, shiny, galvanized Garbage Can lid. Some of the items definitely lacking in BBQ flavor.

Hot Fudge Kahlua Brownie (**) Warm, Walnut covered Chocolate Brownie, soaked with Kahlua Liquer and topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, and (loads and loads of) Whipped Cream. Ice Cream and Kahlua was no-where to be found!

Total tab: $82.08. Not bad for the amount of food.

Service (****) This is a total generalization... but what the heck! The wait-staff at Famous Dave's is totally opposite from the previous evening's robotic lifeless performance from the wait-staff at Olive Garden ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-garden-italian-restaurant-chandler#hrid:l6HajH2UNtb1EZMTj19Ccg  ). I really don't give a darn if it's just a performance... the attitude that the wait-staff presents will be passed onto the customers... whether bad or good.

Typical of all Famous Dave's you sit at a booth or table covered with Red and White checkered table-cloths. At the front entrance is a display of all the BBQ awards that Famous Dave's BBQ items have won.... mostly in the MidWest. Check out the lead-pipe utilitarian interior design... Cool!

Very colorful and festive atmosphere! Kids or adults with a kid's attitude will love Famous Dave's.",high

"When checking in I was greeted by the General Manager. It was nice talking to you Michael; I hope to see you at the Westin La Paloma.

Ugh so early, but my driver was very friendly. The night auditor was very helpful and was able to give my family a late check-out till 1:30. SO AWESOME!  I love late check outs, they make your day/morning better. No need to rush. The bathroom is a little small, vanity area is limited but fully stocked and you get a loofa.

"Okay, did I say bad??
WORSE.
Negative five stars.

From San Diego,
1. they made us wait in line for ticketing.
2. Made us go check our bags

3. Bag agent told us the flight has been delayed 35 min and we have to wait in the ""special needs"" line bc we were gonna miss our connection flight. 

4. Booked another flight. Meanwhile got barked at my a brainless, incompetent, mean lady that was a complete b*tch to us.
She told us there was plenty of time for our next flight and that we should patiently stand in line (and miss that flight).

5. Got on the runway. Plane circled around for about an hour. didn't take off.
6. ""mechanical problems"".
7. kept ppl on the plane for another hour.
8. kicked everybody off saying we weren't taking off on this plane.

9. made everybody wait in a long@$$ line that didn't move while we saw a ticketing agent to rebook our flight (while I held up a DELTA SUCKS sign made with pen and crayon on my sketchbook)

10. hours later after not knowing what to do with us, they placed us in a hotel in downtown SD.
11. We were to take an 8 PM flight the next day to LAX and then 2 hr and 45 min layover.
12. 11:45 PM plane from LAX to Tokyo.... scheduled 4 AM landing in the far east, you kidding me? 
13. THEY LOST MY LUGGAGE. 

~~*~*~*~*~*~*~* another incident:

LAX to Tokyo: ""mechanical problems""
stayed another hour on the plane.
Had them shuttle us to a hotel in the middle of nowhere.
Lost luggage on the way there. It fell out of a bus!

Next morning, 8 AM plane to Busan, Korea.

"My brother from San Francisco was in town and missing the sushi from the bay area. I decided I'd let him choose where we'd go out even though I'd never ever heard of this place before. It was definitely in a not-so-glamorous area, tucked on the side of a dinky shopping center (sorry shopping center). When we walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the quaint atmosphere and set-up. It's definitely small but everyone working there and eating there seemed to be genuinely having a great time. 

We sat at the bar/long table in front of the sushi chefs which was a fun experience. We started off with sake, and it was pretty darn smooth. We ordered a variety of different dishes including sea urchin eggs, yellowtail shashimi and the king crab roll. They were even accomodating to make my brother dishes that weren't on the menu. The chefs are so nice and fun and the prices are pretty good!

My brother was extremely impressed coming from a top sushi city. I look forward to coming back and trying more of their extensive menu, especially for happy hour.",high

I'm not a huge fan of their food but it's always busy so clearly other people don't have my same opinion.

But the apps aren't too bad.",high
"The workers here are helpful and nice.  Especially the chubby Mexican man!  He was awesome and popped up in the veggie aisle and then bagged our groceries too.

"95 reviews? Guess there's nothing I can say about this gem that hasn't been said. We ordered the cheese pizza which is a really inexpensive but delicious tasting Margarita pizza sooo good. 

We also had the vodka penne with tender big pieces of rendered bacon, tomatoes and fresh basil. The vodka sauce was creamy and seasoned very well. They included a ton of grilled french bread and cutlery because they knew I was staying at a hotel. They were really sweet and very fast at getting all that food ready for us. 

It says on their website and on the yelp search engine that Pizza A Metro delivers but they don't. Not a big deal though the food is totally worth going to get yourself.",high

"When I get the urge to eat out, I'm normally drawn to more laid back restaurants where I can sit back, chat, and enjoy my meal.  With a relaxing atmosphere and fun menu (Chicken & Waffles, and S'mores for dessert), I definitely enjoyed this place.  My first time here was for a Yelp event so I was able to try just about everything.  My favorites would have to be the mac & cheese and the beef brisket--both delicious!  I'd say they've got their BBQ technique mastered, at least where the brisket is concerned.  And the cornbread is probably the best I've had--so happy they handed out the recipe at the event.  The service was great; everyone was friendly and very helpful.  I was satisfied with everything here and definitely would come back--and probably leave with tasty leftovers!",high
"The place did not disappoint. The moment we stepped through the archway, my friends and I were bedazzled by the ambience throughout the area.

 It really DOES feel like a tavern, almost like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean (Well.. kind of)

"I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.  
When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously.

Don't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.

From what they said, there was meat on there too,  however i forgot to bring my microscope to verify if there was any on there. This place is like a middle school cafeteria smack dab in the heart of Tokyo's slums (i don't know any Vietnamese cities). Please, homeless people, save your quarters, you're too good for this place. They have good milkshakes, but if you really are homeless (as you should be if you're going to Lee's) you shouldn't be buying ""rich people"" milk shakes anyways, stick with the dollar menu.",low

"Visited for the first time on 11/10/10 around 6pm. The place was empty when we first entered though a group of people came in shortly afterwards.

Overall the place was clean, comfortable and very inviting. The server was helpful and accepted the coupon we had brought in for coffee (buy one get one free). I ordered a 12oz soy milk latte (yes they had soymilk!!) but was disappointed to find out that they were no longer serving yogurt ice cream - I opted to try their blackberry sorbet. My husband had a 16oz Iced Americano and a frozen chocolate covered banana.

I thoroughly enjoyed the soy latte, it was very delicious and filling! The sorbet was also very tasty and fresh. I asked for two scoops when I ordered it and it came in a rather large cup. I did not finish it all as it was just too much for me to eat. I suggest that you plan on sharing if you order 2 scoops! My husband liked his americano and frozen banana and wanted to go back for seconds.

We are hoping to return soon for some more delicious coffee and to try their waffles and ice cream cookies (they looked so inviting!)",high

Every time I visit I am always greeted by the owner (Yoshi) who happens to be Japanese and runs the restaurant as such. Fish is always fresh and consistently high quality, sushi chefs are friendly and always willing to let you try something new. They also have a nice selection of cold sake's available and some random ones in stock off the menu if you ask the owner.
   Atmosphere is very modern/contemporary and in a small suite located next to C-Fu Gourmet. They also have a traditional Japanese seating room in the back that is fun for larger groups etc.. If you are a sushi lover or even a newbie to this style, you will love it!",high

"Cozy, cute and yes, a little claustraphobic...Coronado Cafe. Perhaps the latter adjective is my own issue, but at 5 foot  9 inches I felt REALLY tall. An adorable little home, with creaky wooden floors transformed into a comfortable cafe with approachable American fare. After navigating the dicey, sandy, lumpy parking lot I accidentally entered the kitchen door. My bad. I was redirected to another door and entered through the rear. Yikes did I  just say I entered through the rear? Anyway a lovely staff person told me to go to the front and check in. Meandering through the cafe I really did find it lovely. Very neat, old yet modern and strangely very loud. It was a booming lunch crowd on a Monday. Taking Mom and Dad out for a Mother's Day lunch. We waited a few minutes for a table and were constantly being said hello to and asked if we've been helped by a friendly, friendly staff. Shout out to the staff! The menu, while not especially inventive, seemed fresh and yummy. The soup of the day was a tortilla soup with its own stamp on it. No tortilla strips atop the cup, yet and especially flavorful soup, creamy with a twinge of tanginess to it. Mom and I both had the turkey sandwich with cranberrry sauce. HUGE mother of a sandwich. I always wonder about the big sandwich because you cannot possible bite into it without making a mess. Not a strike against them, cuz it was very good, bread was fresh and turkey seemed unprocessed. Dad ordered the ham and cheese, but stripped away all the interesting flavors, because, well, because he's a dad and likes the meat and potato type menu. Dessert was a wonderful and decedent brownie with ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces. Very good. Brownie was more like a cake though. Again, no complaint, cuz it was dee-lish. Service was so great I have to say. Friendly, professional and fun. I like the idea of eating in an old house. The contrast of old Phoenix with striking photography of modern New York strewn about the rooms was quite cool. I recommend a visit. I'm craving the tortilla soup and would love to try other items on the menu. Most importantly it was a wonderful way to hang with mom and dad (who ventured in from Sun City in their mini van, navigating the Central Ave. mess, God Bless 'em) and we truly had a good experience. Coronado Cafe. Cute. Cozy. Comfortable. And in the end, not so claustraphobic.",low
"I stumbled across this place after missing my usual Light Rail stop on my way to pick up a Zipcar at the downtown ASU campus.

First I tried my usual caffeine fix...a nonfat double latte. Excellent.

Second trip back, I gave the breakfast burrito (plus bacon) a try. Delicious. The tortilla was as good as everything inside.

Third trip, a beet salad and a bacon chocolate chip cookie. Bacon and chocolate for the win!

I've been here three times and have not been disappointed. The decor is modest, but functional, as it should be at a good business with honestly good food. The barista is not only knowledgable and skilled, but is also a genuine sweetheart.

It's just a couple of blocks from the Jefferson and First Street Light Rail stop (East bound), so I've been stopping by on my way to work.",high
"I went to Khai Hoan yesterday and ordered the rare beef pho.  Now, this is the first time I have had pho before and I would say it is much like a glorified bowl of Ramen Noodles.  That said, it was good.  To me, not great, just good.  We got the combination appetizer plate.  The spring roll was amazing.  The crab was great.  I didn't like the ""egg roll"" as much as I thought I would, but it was definitely fresh.  I had fresh coconut juice to drink and it was delightful.  I would go back again for sure, but I would be ordering something other than the pho.",high
"My wife and I originally went last Sunday only to find it closed. But since I had a Groupon deal I purchased last month, we went back Wednesday night to cash it in. And we're so glad we did. Kind of hidden in a shopping mall with movie theaters upstairs, we were quickly seated and served our drinks with chips and salsa. My wife ordered the fish tacos (2) with rice and black beans. Tacos and rice were both good. Black beans so-so. I ordered the Cuban sliders. 3 mini sandwiches w/ham, cheese, and a Cuban seasoned beef - oh so good - with a side of sweet potato fries. Wasn't a fan before. But now I am. Fries were hot and crunchy. I could only put down 2 and took 1 back to our hotel for breakfast Thursday. Would definitely return for another meal when in PHX again.",high
"ALWAYS trying to upsell me on a number of services...high pressure too. I usually point out something that needs special attention (dog hair in the back seat, crumbs on the floor, etc) and they consistently proceed to do a half ass vacuum job. Two stars because the outside of the car usually looks nice and the inside is wiped down pretty well.. Overall, however, these guys need to step up their game. I used to bring my car here when it was under previous ownership and was always pleased with the service. Now I would prefer to drive 10-15 miles further to get a superior car wash.",high

We all decided were not going back. Just because your a good looking server doesn't give you an excuse for sucking.",low
"There are few things I cannot stand more than eating out for pizza-by-the-slice. Those are: slices so big they contain an entire days worth of calories and charging additional for traditional toppings. 

While I understand the appeal of this centralized pizza joint -- a slice is 1/4 the pizza itself. The crust is a couple inches high and the pizza itself is barely 1/4 inch. I had cheese and while cheese pizza isn't remarkable as is, the slice I had here was considerably unimpressive.

We paid $9.31 for 2 slices and a 20 oz beverage. 

What also put me off to this place was the cold staff and multiple things did not seem to be working right while there -- including their ice machine and their sound system (cut on and off). I was also not impressed how, never truly hearing of Sal's before, the employee made it seem like a chain of few. Go to their website and you will realize otherwise. This location is franchised.

I will not return (unless I am not paying). Instead, I will take a jab at one of the other multiple fast food options on that corner.",low
"Surprisingly well organized displays for a location that regularly gets mauled by roving packs of shoppers. 

Great sales and service, a pretty solid seasonal selection but not as comprehensive as some of the larger Anthropologies out there. The person who lays out the stuff at this store seems to space out the perfume bombs at a wider spacing so sensitive noses may be less battered by this store than some others in the Valley.

The clearance racks are gold mines for sizes 8+. They occasionally have shoes, bags and swim items being sold at clearance there from in-store returns.  

( Ladies 0-6 can enjoy amazing clearance picks at the Val Vista and US-60 location! That location also has stock from previous seasons since it is so far out of the way of the typical Anthropologie shopper.)",low
"I am a fan of taco stands in general, but....
This location consistently ruins my beloved bacon, potato, egg and cheese breakfast burrito.  Every now and then they get it just right, but most of the time there's something missing from it.

"St. Francis gives the impression you could be dining in one of the finest cities in the world, instead of the 5th largest cities in the USA.

Dessert MUST be the chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato accompanied by carmel sauce trailings and carmel corn garnishes.

Try dining at the bar for an uncluttered view out the picture window opening, minus the glass.

"Please know that this place is WORTH the long wait.  I come to Phoenix once a month for work and I make sure I have dinner here.  There is NOT one thing I can complain about.  Remember, good things come to those who wait.  I HIGHLY recommend waiting in the house next door and having some wine.  The bartenders are very friendly.  The main restaurant will call the house when your table/bar seat is ready.  The pizza is baked in a stone brick oven.  Real firewood is used, not like California Pizza Kitchen's gas oven.  The owner himself makes the pizza.  Every employee is genuinely nice.  With each bite, you have a subtle taste of smoke (not overwhelming).  The crust is thin and crispy...AND MOST IMPORTANTLY...you can fold the slice - for all you NJ/NY natives!  My stomach is churning and mouth salivating as I write more.  I am going to Phoenix this Thursday...guess where I'll be?  PS-Guys, phenomenal eye candy.",high
"This place is the white-trash Chipotle. The food is mediocre at best. I mean seriously, how can you just up and steal Chipotle's idea! There's no creativity there. The Habenaro Salsa is flavorless and not hot at all. Seriously? I asked for HOT, not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who can't handle real salsa!  At least Chipotle has hot salsa (not too hot either but much better) for a fast Americanized mexican food. Of course I much rather have the real deal but I do like Chiptole for what it is. Not this crap that Qdoba tries to serve up. 
The chicken is over seasoned and highly spiced/herbed you can barely taste the chicken. The Fajita veggie were the same. The product looked of very low quality. Oxidizing Guacamole and Lettuce. The meat looked unappetizing as well. Just not at the level of Chipotle. Although I have been here twice, this is the last time for me. I have been to one in Denver and for some reason thought it was better. So maybe it's management but I can say the food is less than good. I much rather go to Chiptole than this wannabe! Employees were dumber than a bag of Frijoles!
This place has the worst ""Mexican"" Food I have ever had next to a pre made burrito from 7-11 or a burrito from Taco Bell. Just disgusting food.",low

"I see Jenny Strebe who cuts and Veronica Peebles who colors. They are AMAZING! I am so glad they opened Salon Stylush, it is the perfect size (not too huge and crazy) and it is so modern & cute! 

Jenny is an amazing hair stylist with the accolades to prove it (she styles hair for fashion shows, magazines, television, etc). Jenny has been cutting my hair for years and she is super sweet and super talented. I trust her with my hair, no question, and recommend her highly. Also, she has a talent for men's hair as well. She cuts my husband's hair and that is one of his best qualities (I'd say!). There are so many men out there with bad hair - Jenny knows how to make it work for men!

Veronica has colored my hair for years - and she is hands down one of the best in the industry. I never loved my color until I found Veronica. Now, I trust her completely and know she'll make my hair look great, and natural, which is important to me. She's also super sweet! I highly recommend Veronica as a stylist and colorist.",high

Despite the fact that I was short one babysitter, they began work on my nails right away and when my toddler got restless, one of the very nice owners picked her up and carried her around for 20 minutes!  Not only do they now offer Gelish gel manicures but they offer more colors than many other Arcadia/Biltmore/Camelback Corridor nail salons AND they're cheaper by anywhere from $5-$20!

"Here's an update, because the buffet is out at lunchtime only now, with a regular menu at dinnertime:

This old place continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley, after 1 1/2 years & many visits.  It's friendly, inexpensive, peaceful & comfortable (even with lots of customers), & always satisfying.

This time I started with a delicious bowl of Menudo, a nice salad & several kinds of fresh fruit, tasty Cole Slaw, & then headed for the Mexican hot table.  Had some Spanish Rice, refried beans, a beef taquito, an excellent beef tamale (hand made, not some fast-food thing pretending to be a tamale!), & more, but saving room for some Chinese.

The tasty treats over at the Chinese hot table included TERRIFIC, big, meaty barbecued pork ribs, really good & crispy Sweet & Sour Pork (Hey Iain!), just-right fried rice, a steamed veggies dish in fish juice that included such treats as Chinese Snow Peas, all cooked just enough, & so on.

What a great lunch for $5.59!",high
"Went here for a saturday lunch with a girlfriend. The building is amazing and beautiful, very clean. I'm not generally a ""Scottsdale crowd"" type of gal, but the place was nice, and the music was good too. The menu looked so delicious that we had a hard time deciding what to get. Our waiter was very kind, didn't try to rush us, and gave us plenty of time to decide. 

We had a house salad, dirty chips, and an order of sliders. The house salad seemed a bit over priced for what it was, but the dirty chips were really good! The sliders were average, and well priced.

I really want to go back and try a happy hour sometime to try more of the small plates, our only regret was that the order of dirty chips was BIG, we could only finish half of it. A half sized portion would have been perfect, though!",high
"Another vacation that started and ended with US Airways.

Friendly staff...store is usually pretty quiet when I go in which is nice as I cannot stand crowds! Mens selection is a little skimpy .. however when I go there it's usually just to sell. On that note, they pay you 5% more of the retail value of any of your clothing than Buffalo does!

"Business takes me out to Mesa yesterday.  After chatting with a friend about possible lunch locations, he tells me about Georges Gyros, near University and Country Club.  I decide to give it a try, as it isn't too far from my destination.  Situated right next door to Sun Devil Liquors, I'm surprised I hadn't been there before, or, for that matter, even noticed it.  I guess when I hit SDL, I've got tunnel vision.  First thing I notice is there appears to be plenty of parking, even at 12:30, for lunch.  Outer patio, stuck out into the parking lot, not overly appealing, might be nicer in the evening, I guess?  The interior is clean, plenty of seating, a small bar at one end, and a counter from which you place your order.  Never having been before, I ask the counter-person for a recommendation.  ""What's good?""  He suggests the Original Gyro, served with fries or a greek salad.  Sounds good, I'll take it with fries.  With drink, under $9.  A few moments later (actually, I saw three other tables get served, so it seemed like a longish wait), a ginormous gyro arrives, with a huge helping of fries.  The gyro was huge, overflowing with, umm, meat, gyro meat, I guess, white onions, diced tomatoes and cucumber sauce (Tzatziki, I think).  The meat was well cooked, artfully shaved, and tender.  The sauce was also very good.  The pita?  Warm, soft and tasty.  The fries? Crisp and golden brown, and piping hot, about 3-4 times the size of Mickie D's or about 1/2 a 'steak fry'.  I was very impressed with the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the dining area, and the presence of a bar.  Most folks were eating gyros, or good sized greek salads.  Other items on the menu include several different gyros, burgers, sandwiches, a decent selection of pasta dishes and all kinds of Greek and non-Greek appetizers.  I plan on coming back, perhaps before a foray into Sun Devil Liquors...",high
"Where I had the most delicious thing I ever put in my mouth.

This is a favorite of me and my friends, especially for sunday morning brunch. I would say we go at least one time a week. Their Quiche (especially the Goat cheese, caramelized onions, and wallnuts) is the best you will ever have and their salad dressing (which is made in house) is equally delicious. The most delicious thing I have ever eaten in my whole life was actually a rose macaroon. I have never had an emotional reaction to a food item before but I swear I almost cried and had flashbacks of my childhood being at the botanical gardens. Any way, if you haven't been here you HAVE to go. Its one of Arizona's few authentic cultural treasures.",high
"The new, old El Chorro Lodge has been reopened for all of two days, and a friend of a friend managed to secure a reservation during their soft opening, so I got an opportunity to check it out.  I was impressed, but not blown away.  Everything I tasted was quite competent, but if I had to choose a word to describe the menu, I would suggest ""staid.""  Perhaps even ""stodgy,"" but that may be more harsh than I intend.

Review the dinner menu.  http://bit.ly/aWqVVJ.  There, see what I mean?  Replete with Traditional American entrees and sides, at what I would consider fairly exorbitant prices.  I would say that I wouldn't go back to eat this food at these prices, unless someone else was paying.  

I should note that a big part of why I wasn't impressed is because this place is simply not my style.  The wait staff, attired in khakis and blue shirts, was a little too informal for the prices we were paying, I felt.  The menu options were a little boring for my taste.  The cocktail menu is exactly not what I'm looking for these days, although I will be very interested to see what Happy Hour looks like.  The decor is a tad heavy on the Old Southwest theme, although to be fair, this place not only pulls it off rather stylishly but also is among the most authentically old and southwestern establishments in the Phoenix metro area.  

The patio and open bar are fantastic.  The bar area is considerable, and the patio is palatial - up above Lincoln Dr enough to be fairly quiet, with a gorgeous view of Camelback, sunset here must be incredible.  

Anyway, back to the food.  Everything was very well executed, from the sticky buns we were served upon being seated to the desserts we ordered.  I chose the soup of the day to start, a tomato/basil concoction that was quite hearty and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The salads my dining companions ate looked boring to me, but they all claimed them to be excellent, with ""the best Caesar dressing ever"" and ""polenta croutons?!?"" being the verdict for the Caesar salad, at least.  On to the entrees.  I ordered the crispy duck, which I found to be delicious and quite hearty, though not what I would call crispy by any means.  It was a very sizable portion, and very well prepared.  My dining companions ordered the pork chop, the lamb, and the salmon, and we each sampled from each other's plates.  I would try the lamb if I went back, but the consensus seemed to be that everything was very well prepared, with the duck being a winner.  It was served with a heap of mushy sweet potatoes (just like my mom makes at Thanksgiving - delicious!) and red cabbage, which I sampled and declined to finish.  Again, not quite my style.  

We moved on to dessert - sticky bread pudding with a bourbon glaze and the warm chocolate cake.  The bread pudding was a winner at the first two or three bites, but grew one-dimensional as I continued nibbling at it.  The chocolate cake was decadent, among the best I've ever tasted.  It was clearly made with a considerable amount of dark chocolate, which seals the deal for me.  And in case you were wondering, my dining companions apparently have no stamina when it comes to dessert.  Suckers.  

Anyway, as I've said now several times, this place is just not quite me.  It's totally classy and very high in quality, but not quite adventurous enough for my taste.  I'd love to come back for brunch, and once they unveil their happy hour menu, I'm sure I'll be back to check it out, but I won't be back for dinner unless I can convince someone else to pick up the check at the end of the evening.  

As a side note, this place is so very Paradise Valley.  It's a welcome relief knowing that there is a place that is so anti-scene out there.  It's been a little while since I've been both the youngest and among the poorest in a room, and I will say it was a little comforting.  Just don't tell the Scottsdale people about this place, and we'll all be happy.",high
"I've not stayed at this resort, but have been here twice; once for a wedding and the other for a Lunch & Learn event.  Valet service each time was quick and the guys were professional and pleasant.  The grounds of the resort are kept meticulously clean and there were clear skies and greenery everywhere I looked; so beautiful.

Lunch & Learn (Aug 18th):

The event started a little past noon and ended a little past 3pm.  We reserved for six, but it's based on a first come, first served basis.  Two of us arrived a little after 11:30am and after paying our respective $75 fee, went to find a table that would afford us good views of the chef's station.  Unfortunately the best tables (with direct views of the chef's station) had ""Reserved"" placards on them, so we ended up with one off to the right of the chef's station.  I would recommend arriving early to grab good seats; tables are set for ten.  There are two large TV screens in the room, in case you're not able to see the chef directly.  

Our event was hosted by Chef MacMillan (gave the guests a few good laughs), with featured guest chef Kevin Binkley (owner of Binkley's Restaurant in Cave Creek).  The servers weren't obtrusive and kept our water and wine glasses full.  

We started off with a glass of champagne, which wasn't great, but was appreciated and added to the festive ambiance.  For this event, we were served three courses:  an appetizer (chilled cucumber soup), entrée (two-wash ranch chicken), and dessert (huckleberry semi-fredo).  Each course was paired with a different glass of wine:  John Anthony Sauvignon Blanc (white, appetizer), Andre Brunel Cote du Rhone (red, entrée), and Pietro Rinaldi Moscato d'asti (dessert).  I'm not usually a fan of Sauvignon Blanc (I favor Riesling), but the John Anthony won me over.  

Chef Binkley went over his background and demonstrated the process that goes with making the chilled cucumber soup (which is quite involved).  The soup, albeit a bit salty, was SO good.  Everyone raved about it, and the best part of the dish for me was the charred red onion.  The two-wash ranch chicken entrée was good overall; however, my chicken was a bit dry and tough to cut.  This might be a one-off thing since others at the table said their chicken was moist.  Loved the sweet potato puree and Chantrell mushrooms.  The only real complaint I had was the lack of a demo for the entree and dessert.  With that said, I can understand why the chef needed to be in the kitchen...after all, we needed to eat, right? ;P

Other highlights:
*  Live band entertained with great hits (a bit loud though for lunchtime)
*  Recipes to take home
*  Q & A with the chef (and photo ops)
*  Raffles for a few prizes, which two of my friends won (a gift box of caramel brownies and one-night stay at the Sanctuary with dinner)

Wedding (Friday, March 23rd):

The ceremony was held at 5pm on the grounds near the ballroom.  The weather was a bit warm, but not unbearably so.  The bride and groom were beautiful (so was the service), but it was a bit distracting to see people observing us from the windows of the Jade Bar, which overlooked the grounds where the ceremony was held.

After the ceremony, we took a short hike up the stairs for cocktail hour, held just outside the ballroom.  It was such a beautiful experience to have a glass of wine, nibble on hors d'oeuvres, chat with friends, and watch the sun go down (with the mountains as a backdrop).

The reception was held in the ballroom and was decorated beautifully.  The food was great, the wine and alcohol was flowing, and the live (Latin) band made for a great evening.  My friend used Sanctuary's wedding planner (and caterer) and they did a great job.",high
"Phoenix has some absolutely amazing Italian pizza joints. And when I'm in the mood to spend some extra money and wait a while I go to them.

But man alive! Red Devil is pretty close in terms of quality and it's a lot more laid back.

During our last visit, we sat in back. The space has several nice little tucked away areas so everywhere has a nice private feel. Our waitress was really nice and accomodating and was with us in just over a minute.

Some of the fancier drinks were recommended, but we were content with just plain old lemonade. Just the right balance of sweet and tangy.

The bruschetta arrived quickly fresh out of the oven. The oil and tomatoes were spilling over the top and had a very rich flavor.

The Italian pizza was just right temperature wise and the green olives added a nice salty kick to the sausage.

The prices are reasonable. The staff is great and the pizza is delicious. 

Plus we met a 6 year old in the parking lot who claimed to be a princess. How great is that?",low

"I graduated from Marinello at the end of August 2010, and let me tell you, I was glad to get out of there.
While the teachers were very knowledgeable in their trade, the program and administration is less than desirable. When I first toured the school and started classes in January, I was promised many things to learn, one of them being makeup classes. Still to this day they do not have those classes available at the school, and those were pretty big reasons to why I wanted to go there.
There was also a lot of drama in the midst of my schooling there. Several administrators left, a teacher left, and they changed everything that we were used to. They started focusing on advertising instead of getting students product to use, and there was a lot of times when school product would go missing when they didn't go missing before the administration change.
besides those things, the school is okay. At the very least, it will teach you what  you need to know to be an aesthetician in the state. But I definitely wouldn't go there again, and I definitely wouldn't recommend anybody to go there. Be sure to look around at other schools before you decide what's best for you.",high
"This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  It's not the same anymore.

We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.

We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.

The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.

While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.

So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.",low

What are you craving at the moment?  Perhaps a cup of coffee?  a scoop of gelato?  an empanada? gourmet pastry?  homemade tomato soup?  perhaps a panini sandwich filled with turkey, cheese,  grilled eggplant, and cranberry compote? red wine? magazine? fresh fruit? Diet Coke?

Whatever your 'crave-ing' - Crave has it all!

In addition to pretty much anything your heart desires, Crave also has an extremely friendly staff and offers limited seating (in and outside) with gorgeous views of Camelback mountain.

After a full tour of the resort, we were hungry for lunch and decided to have a quick bite at Crave... We shared a sandwich, slice of quiche, and tomato soup - all of it was delicious!  I am sure I'll be craving a return trip to the Montelucia sometime soon, and when I do, I'm sure I'll pop into Crave for whatever I need at that time.",high
"Cannot rate their technical service because they NEVER SHOWED UP or CALLED TO RESCHEDULE.  I made a service call appointment with Flores Air and received a time of ""around noon"" and we will call in advance.  I received a call at 11 and they said they were in the area and could be there in about 45 minutes.  After a no-show, I called them around 1 and the man said they were stuck at a job and would not make it.  I rescheduled with them for two days later.  They said they could get there around 3.  No call that day and I have not seen them.  Today is another day and still no call from them.  I will not be calling them back again to schedule another NO-SHOW.

"prepare to spend a few hours here and really have a romantic experience. the food is divine. the service is laid back (in a good way). the chef runs the whole show and plays all hats. the menu is forever changing and when you make a reservation he will ask you questions so he can tailor your meal and experience to your needs. probably not a good first date place because if the date goes wrong, you will be stuck for a while. perfect spot for an anniversary or something. or even just to have a nice meal with people you know and care about.",high
"Hands down, the best pizza in the East Valley!!!! Tastes like I'm back in New York City, that's how good the pizza is! They do all sorts of combinations and toppings. Mmmm mmmm good. The hero sandwiches and wings are good too. Located in a strip mall next to AMC movie theaters, it's a great place to go before or after the movies. And they deliver, too. Much better quality than chain pizzerias.",high
"Delicious, fresh, flavorful, with a lot of meat and vegetarian options to please any discerning palate.  They also offer soups and salads, which I hear are equally as delicious, and many different options for sides.  It's sad to see that this plaza, which used to house Michael's and several other stores, is now nearly defunct, and the last remaining vestiges of this plaza's prime days is this deli, Pong Pong Chinese food, which is right next door, and a few other specialty stores.

My favorite so far is the Southwest wrap.  The Buena Bella vegetarian sandwich, though touted as a healthy alternative, seems to be a bit too salty to make it really that healthy for you.",high
"The husband and I went here for breakfast the other morning at about 9 am.  The patio was about 2/3 full but the inside was empty.  When you first walk in, you are greeted with menus that are extremely reminiscent of Pei Wei.  Turns out, you order the exact same way at said restaurant and you even get a number and choose your own table.  As I sat waiting for my food, I contemplated whether or not this concept worked well for breakfast.  The place started getting busy about 3 minutes after we sat down and I discovered the concept works quite well.

So many things on the menu looked delicious, and I had a hard time deciding what to get.  For starters, they have pancakes with peanut butter chips!  YUM!  Any restaurant that does peanut butter chip pancakes gets bonus points from me.  The rest of the menu varies from omelets to brizzas (breakfast pizzas) to good ol pigs in a blanket.  The husband and I decided to share a few things.  We got the peanut butter chip pancakes, the pigs in a blanket, and a cinnamon roll.  The pancakes were awesome and HUGE!  After just one I was already feeling full.  The pigs in a blanket were absolutely delicious, primarily because of the yummy and kind of spicy breakfast link.  The cinnamon roll was also tasty, nice and fresh, but not too cinnamony.  

Back to the concept of this place... once it had started to pick up again in terms of customers, I noticed how quickly the cashier was able to clear out the line.  I also noticed that the food was coming out at a really quick pace, and absolutely nothing sat on the line waiting to be served.  It works really well, but I am most interested in seeing how it works when the place gets absolutely slammed.

Overall, this is an excellent place to try.  You will not be disappointed with your fresh and delicious breakfast that doesn't make you feel heavy and gross after you leave.  A cool place for sure.",high

"Citizen Public House is a great addition to the Old Town dining scene. I love seeing restaurants crop up in that part of town that aren't just catering to the bar scene and making the food an afterthought. My girlfriend and I made reservations for Friday night expecting Bernie Kantak's new restaurant to be packed. Much to our surprise when we arrived, the place was pretty dead with tons of open tables. We purposely arrived early to enjoy a cocktail at the bar and even though we could have been seated right away, we pressed forward with our original plan.

At the bar, I ordered my usual cocktail while the GF ordered a sangria off their cocktail menu. We also ordered an order of the bacon fat heirloom popcorn from the bar snacks menu. My cocktail was perfectly made and my GF loved the sangria. The popcorn took forever to come out, but when it was delivered they also brought out an order of the calamari compliments of the chef. The popcorn was a little bit burned and we both thought it could have used some salt, which was surprising since we thought the bacon fat would have provided that flavor. The calamari was perfectly cooked and not greasy in the least. I enjoyed the pickled fennel on the side, but my GF isn't a fan of fennel, so she didn't try it.

After we finished our cocktails at the bar, we moved to a table for the main event. In an unusual move for us, we skipped wine and stuck with beer and cocktails, but I did eye some good finds on the concise wine list. For our appetizer, we ordered the sausage of the day, which was a beef based sausage with a cabbage casing. It was very unique and we both really enjoyed it. For our main courses, the GF ordered the AZ B.L.T. and ordered the Pork Tender Loin. The B.L.T. had tons of perfectly crispy bacon on it, but we both agreed that it was really good , but not great overall. The Pork Tender Loin, on the other hand, was excellent in my opinion. I loved the figs and the sweet potato-chevre strudel. Of course, you could put chevre on anything and I would like it.

When it was time for dessert, we knew that we had to try some of Tracy Dempsey's latest creations. We normally split dessert, but decided to each get our own. The GF got the cookies and milk and I had the chocolate toffee bread pudding. The cookies are delivered in a bag that you can take home, which is great because you probably won't down the generous serving of cookies in one setting  unless you're sharing. My GF was quite happy to take home a little bag of cookies to enjoy later. My bread pudding was awesome and I wish I could have purchased a gallon of the Maker's Mark ice cream to take home with me. I'll definitely be craving this dessert in the future.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is a little austere, even for my taste. It just seems like they could a little bit to make it a little bit more warm and inviting. Service, while extremely friendly, was a little bit uneven throughout the night starting with the snacks at the bar taking a long time and continuing with confusion over what tables plates should be delivered to. Keep in mind the restaurant has been open for only a week, so these are things that can be worked out.

We were really surprised to see the restaurant so empty on a Friday night, so I hope more people give it a try. Citizen is a really good neighborhood restaurant that has the potential to be great. We look forward to trying it again to see how it improves and evolves. I'm really hoping it's a successful staple in Old Town for years to come.",high
"Well, we all  went to a going away party here at Casey Moore's Oyster House and the place was fairly nice lots of security around  but very limited parking (we parked a few blocks away and had to walk in) food was good but my onion soup was way to salty though and the dip sandwich was by far the worst item to order on the menu (just sliced meat and bread)  and I had order it.  My wife ordered the shrimp scampi and for some reason it came out with a heavy cream sauce, no complaints because it was good but it was not scampi.  Tuna was perfect I had a chance to taste it  and that cooked perfect and I did notice a co- worker leave the 1/2 of the fish and chips on there plate no a good sign.  Clam chowder was good as a few friends did say they enjoyed it.  Calamari was off the chain ""Perfect"".  The server was warm,  friendly and polite and had some great suggestions for dinner and was very patient and waited for us to have  few rounds before we ordered dinner.  The place is pretty big and it seems that if you would come and sit in a different place each time it would be like going to a different place.  Music was jamming something for everyone. Folks were friendly and the place was packed.   

Now, cleanliness it  seems like it could use a wipe down, moping an a power wash in a few spots but I guess after a few cold ones you don't see it anymore.  Will I go back?  Yes, I would, affordable food, good music and  folks all in a good mood I'm there.

I've been to all of the chains and was thinking that maybe I should finally find just one person to cut my hair for now on until I got a coupon. I really enjoyed my visit, I didn't get the MVP thing cause I wasn't expecting it and I didn't have time for it. They are all pretty knowledgeable and quick. Only once was I not fully happy with the cut, but it's hair it grows back. They are a bit more pricey but I always go with a coupon, I get them every month. I'm not the most talkative person so it gets kinda awkward when you sit there in silence so I love that you can just sit there and watch sportscenter.",low
"Cliché Central. 

Style without substance can be summed up in their cheese plate: pineapple, melon, grapes, herbed chevre, Babybel minis (they even leave the wax on for ya) and cubes of pepper jack and colby jack served with sesame crackers.  I can't make this gold up.  

They serve a lot of ""martinis"" as the name implies, very few of which actually contains the ingredients for a proper martini.  But then again, now that I've described the cheese plate, this should come as no surprise.  

If you, dear reader, decide to open a bar, it's really quite simple.  Get everyone drunk, quickly, and hire bathroom attendants willing to squirt soap into your customers' hands.  Oh hell no, we're not in a recession.  The Ferrari up front was paid in cash, I'm quite sure.  And that woman over there? 100% real.  

Ok that degraded fairly quickly.  Like my evening.

"So, my friend and I went first to Yasu because we heard it was great. We were traveling on business and therefore using company plastic. So, we show up and the kid working the door says in a very ""Spicolli-like"" voice, ""uh.... our credit card machine is broken tonight""..... So we replied that we were on expense accounts and would there be any way they could manually run our credit cards... The guy replies, ""dude, you're outta luck""....

Funny, considering that I am a guy who eats out a lot and am not afraid to spend a lot of money in a place when the food and service is good... I wont be going back in there...

So we made our way to Hiro..... We were pissed and hungry after driving around and dealing with idiots all over town. Hiro was just what the doctor ordered. We sat down and were greeted and served drinks right away. We put our sushi order entirely in the hands of our chef who did not disappoint. He brought out order after order of fresh delicious sushi and sashimi... We had beer, sake and a great night.... When it was said and done, we spent about $250 for the two of us which was a lot but well worth it..... I'm sure you could go and have a great meal for much less, but we were going big and NOT PAYING!!!!!  Morale of the story is that Yasu's children working that night ran us out and straight to their competition where we will be spending money in the future... Go check out Hiro!",high
"I'll go easy because they just opened this location.

1)  The onion ring batter won't stay on the onion.  The onion was a bit raw too.  Try soaking the rings for 24 hours in buttermilk.  Then coat twice.  Season the flour with garlic and pepper.  Works for me!

2)  The happy hour menu is weak!.  Pretty much chips and snacks type stuff.  Nothing good like sliders etc.

3)  The kids mac & cheese is out of a box.  Really guys?  It takes two seconds to make mac  & cheese from scratch.  Go to allrecipes.com if you need help.

4)  The burger meat is good in flavor but the burger lacks seasoning.

5)  The menu is way too big.  A scaled down menu with better quality would be better.

6)  The nachos are nasty with that queso cheese.  People love traditional nachos.  Stack them high and layer them with cheddar.  all the toppings.  You are a sports bar.

7)  IMO.. drop all of the steaks etc from the menu.  You're a sports bar.  Leave that to Mastros and Flemings.  People want GOOD bar food in a sports bar.

Bottom line....  love the atmosphere, food is OK, beer was cold, price is a little high for what you get, menu is too big, quality of food is OK.  What would I do?  Interview a new fresh Chef to bring in some changes.  

Good luck.  I'll stop by again for a happy hour and give you another try.  Cheers.",high
Best cheese steaks since the last time i was in Philly. Highly recommended,high
"I used to be a huge fan of this place, but it was just ok this time around..

A bunch of us went and I ordered their steak for two.. 22oz. Thought it might be good.  It was dry and had no flavor.  She had asked at the beginning ""Do you guys want A-1?""  I said ""No thanks.""  A good steak shouldn't need any sauce.  I should have asked for a ton of it.. just ugg..

We also got their artichoke, which was actually not too bad.  I love the one they do at Cheesecake  Factory. if you combine both, you have the ultimate smoked artichoke.  

Everyone was ok with their meal and one of my friends loved his.  He got the chicken fried steak.  Cant really mess that up I guess.  it was pretty good.

"This is the old Rigatony's on Brown Rd- If you've never been, it has a Buca di Bepo-ish, before Buca was cool, sort of feel. They even serve their house chianti in a small water glass, instead of a wine goblet- adding to an authentic ""Joisey"" kind of feel.

This is traditional Italian-American fare, rich and flavorful- with big portions. The Chicken Piccata is crack-good. It's served in what I've come to learn is a Sicilian style, with a n awesome relish of tomatoes, capers, and green olives and a side of addictive Fett Alfredo. It never gets old.

Another great authentic dish is their Cecca- you can get it as a ""Pie"" (Pizza, that is) or over pasta. You just have try it. It's rich, refreshing, and explosively flavorful all at once.

The house salad is a variation on a traditional AntiPasto theme- and is a meal, and event, in and of its self.

The best thing about Mardeneley's is that EVERYTHING on the menu is good! It only gets Four stars because it could use a bit more snob appeal (and a better beer selection).",high
"I've been here twice, which was obviously enough. The first time was in 2002, before I was old enough to drink legally. It became obvious to me then that state fairs are only fun for people over 21 or under 12.

In 2008, I came with some friends who bought a $6 hamburger at one of the tents, took one bite, and threw it in the trash. One of them remarked later that it was the only time in his life he'd spit food out in disgust. While this was happening, another friend and I asked a toothless Vietnam veteran manning another tent where we could find the nearest restroom. His reaction suggested that we were insane for asking such a ridiculous question; we surmised that perhaps, due to some bizarre war injury, he had not taken a piss since 1973. Bottom line, customer service is not high on the priority list at the state fair. Nor is edible food.",high
"OK, I am new in town so I was unaware that they are trying to change the name of this event to The Great Arizona Picnic, or something of the like.  Well, thank God because when I hear ""culinary,"" my mind certainly does not think of Dos Gringos...or any of the other Vendors represented at this event.  And why the hell, after paying to enter, would I pay again to enter the fenced areas!?  WTF!?  

I come from a town where festivals are managed better than most corporations so I believe that I am spoiled, but there is no excuse for the long lines encountered here.  I counted over 60 people in line waiting for pizza...pizza!  Lines to enter, lines to use the ATM, lines to purchase tickets, lines to eat, lines to pee......

Obviously I feel passionate about this particular review, and for those that love this festival, I apologize.  I will say that many people with whom I had spoken who had been coming to this festival for years said that it is no longer what it once was.

On a positive note, the people watching is tremendous.  I have never seen so many beautiful people in one location in my life.  And I would agree that it all depends on the company.  Great friends make this a fun event.",high

It's less about business and more about getting back into the swing of the things, having a few laughs on the basepads and shaking hands with the people who really live and die by their fandom. 

Most of the seats beyond 1B and #b sides are benches, another throwback, but really, there isn't a bad seat to watch a game.

"Trust me... no one wants this place to do well more than me. However, after 4 visits I have to confess that it is a solid 2-stars. I'm confident in my comments... and maybe a little heartbroken.

2. I'm a big pasta-crazed fool. Seriously love it.  

3. Love dwntwn Phx.

So what could go wrong? 

Service: 
No one to greet you properly at the door. The space is awkward enough as it is.  Staff was always inattentive and often seen hanging out at the bar. When asked why cocktails the ""signature cocktails"" took so long to prepare, the server responds clumsily ""Because I had to read and learn how to make them just now."" Yikes.

Back to the greeting... We waited about 2 minutes in the doorway listening to staff sitting at the bar chat about how they hoped they could close early that night. It was only 4:30 pm.

Vibe:
The space feels cold and almost clinical. With the lack of fabric in the space, it feels like I'm the ER of a hospital (minus the curtains that surround each patient bed.) The staff certainly doesn't add warmth. Also reminds me of a corporate staff break room. Art on the walls is just bizarre (read other's comments.)

The Cocktails:
They look good on paper. See my comment above about Service. That's all I can really say. 

The Food:
Each time, the Fritto Misto app ($9) was salty and sad to look at. Orecchiette with Sausage ($15) looks fantastic on paper, but never quite right. 

In fact, I've tried every pasta dish on the menu. I'm simply heartbroken. I crave handmade fresh pasta, but the pasta here just leaves me guessing... I'm I the odd ball out? Why do all these Yelpers love the pasta? It's wimpy and the proteins almost taste boiled (texture and flavor.) Approx quote from a guest, ""gummy handmade pasta that looks like bloated playdoh in water."" The sauces seem near amateur as if they were never tasted before serving. Usually on the salty side.

Forget about portions, price, space, ambiance, whatever. The important question... DOES IT TASTE GOOD? 

Sadly, no.

At each visit, I brought other notable chefs from the Valley. In one instance, the five of us ordered an entire dinner, ate a few bites of each dish, asked for the bill and decided to head next door to Sens for dinner (which is another review in the making.)

I'll wait till sometime in the fall season before heading back to Pasta Bar. Maybe it needs more time (although it's been open for a few months already.) 

As always, I'd encourage you to try it out and make your own decision. Wade is a talented chef who can do amazing things in the kitchen. I have faith in you my friend!

Side note... for those of you who fixate on butter and bread service at restaurants, do us all a favor and stick to your cheap filler salad bars. Bread and butter service is simply never worth commenting on as a crucial component of a meal unless it's stellar.  (BTW... I realize the irony of making commentary on the worthless comments)",high
"At length: A trip to Kauai for our friends' wedding several years back led us to Puka Dog and the discovery of another type of holy matrimony: the perfect union of frankfurters and tropical fruit. Our friends are still together eight years later, but how my hot dogs have longed for the companionship of a little pineapple and banana relish.

Disconsolate from my long lost love, I have abstained from the hot dog community (except for Ted's, because it's amazing and what happens in Tempe, stays in Tempe) until a new beau arrived: Maui Dog.

In short (ish): Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got Maui Dog in my tummy. I tried the Sweet & Spicy Dog (favorite!!!) and the Lava Dog (messy!!!) and the house made fries. Everything was delish, and I'll be back to try the rest. The restaurant is a cute, clean, pseudo-dive (kind of a Two Hippies vibe) with a few tables inside and a dog-friendly patio (tee-hee). It's funky and it's affordable. Go ahead, try it. You just might fall in love.",high
"I am a huge ""foodie"", from a long line of ""foodies"". I grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining. This is the best, very best, breakfast restaurant EVER! I have been living in Tempe for about six years now, the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existed...after my first visit, this is my go-to, best place to recommend, favorite breakfast place to eat at! If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The place is very clean. Prices are amazing! Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food. Huge portions and great quality food. I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldn't care. I feel like home here. Everything on the menu is delicious! I've tried almost everything. Here are a few of my favorites (don't forget though, I love it all) :
O'Pear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes! you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table). Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing! I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts! Just delicious! I wish everyone knew about this well kept secret. DON'T LISTEN TO ANY REVIEW UNDER A 5 STAR! This place is the best, bottom line. Try it. You will be hooked.",high
"After weeks of anticipation, Side Bar has finally opened.  As you ascend the staircase to the second level, the reason for the long wait becomes apparent.  The attention to detail is amazing.  Once layered with crumbling plaster, the walls were meticulously stripped to reveal the historic brickwork.  Other historic elements include the original steel casement windows that feature a view of downtown phoenix and the surrounding area. Tastefully integrated with these elements is a contemporary interior design.  The lighting consists of warm colors that set the stage for the laid back atmosphere.  No expense was spared when designing the bar and tables, which are made of dark exotic woods.  Seating included organically shaped bar stools that adjust to a comfortable height and depth.  There are also several u-shaped sofas that create conversational areas.  Behind the bar you'll see an array of artistically arranged circular openings backlit in a warm, yellow tone.  Thick glass shelving lines the back wall along with a fine assortment of liquors.  The ""soft opening"" menu included wines and locally brewed beers among others.  I tried a White Russian and my wife had a glass of Chardonnay.  Both were very good.  Prices seemed to be close to average for the area and when compared to the experience, were a good value.  I had a chance to speak to one of the owners who was glowing with excitement.  After two years of remodeling and working with the city and adjacent historic neighborhood, his vision has become reality.  In addition to a brief history of his endeavor, the owner informed me that additional overflow parking will be available adjacent to the main parking lot.  Parking was one concern originally voiced by the neighborhood and city.  The owners may also experiment with weekly art showings by local artists.  Maybe they can arrange for it to coincide with First Fridays.  Within walking distance of Side Bar, dining includes Pei Wei, My Florist, and Zoe's Kitchen.   
If you're looking for a unique hangout in an urban setting, then Side Bar comes highly recommended.",high
Went to Cracker Barrel twice while vacationing at our home in Litchfield Park.  All the food we ordered were very good and the service was good also.  I highly recommend their pancakes.,high
"One of my favorite parks that I've been to! There are two areas, small and big. I have a small dog so I go into the little dog park. The running room in this area is much more limited than the big dog area, but that's ok - it seems to be enough room for the little ones. There is a water faucet to fill up water bowls and allow your dogs to cool off.

One of my favorite features are the trees! It's a mature park and the trees are gorgeous. They provide lots of shade and make for a relaxing soundtrack. 

This is one of the furthest parks from my house, but I always make the trek out there just to come here.",high
"I found this place whilst trying to find good mac and cheese places on yelp. I'll be honest, I love my wine and I love my cheese. Bonus points if its melted over mac.

And they do great mac and cheese. Some better than others- my favorite so far has actually been the spinach and pesto. If you want the chorizo, I say pass. The spinach or the bacon is much better. If you're into bleu cheese, the bleu cheese mac is VERY bleu. Take that for what it's worth. 

That's not all they do either. Their entrees are consistently great. My boyfriend got some scallops that were incredible, though I don't think it's on their menu now.

Their wines are great too. I'll be honest, I'm no connoisseur, but they had a moscato from Israel that the bf still drools over. It's enough that the next time I was there I picked up a whole bottle, just for him. I've also had one of their mojitos and that was great as well.

As a note- if you're in for happy hour and get a cheese plate... I really do think its better to splurge and get a regular cheese plate. I got a happy hour cheese plate, and it's... miniscule. All of the stuff that made their non happy hour cheese plate awesome was diminished. 1 cheese instead of 3. No boursin. Fewer crackers. Less of that fantastic orange blossom honey and apples. You get my drift. 

Definitely a must try. Service is great and attentive, and it's always been nice and quiet when I went in.",low
"Lost 2 stars!  Sat in the restaurant for 15 minutes ... no waitress ... no water ... no nothing.  We left.

Sad part was there was people who left, then came back and got service before us.  The guy who came in after us got seated, hot tea and his order taken while we just sat and waited.  SERIOUSLY doubt we will be going back now.  If you have an hour or so to kill, you can wait for your food/service in there.",high
"I have been going to Niro's for several years.  You can always count on them fulfilling your your order very quickly and with consistently good quality.

When I am in a hurry between meetings I can count on Niro's to deliver a better experience than I could get at a random fast food joint.

The gyros are good, the french fries are hot and crisp and the service is always friendly.",high
"The bill was 150.00 and that was after a free appetizer coupon they sent me via email.  The food was no where near worth the HIGH price!  The service was not up to par either.  I really can't believe people pay such high prices for food that come with NO sides, etc.  I got iced tea to drink and it cost a whopping $6.00.  That's right folks....6.00 for a glass of tea.  What is that 100% profit/mark up?  I paid 12.00 for a soup sampler.  Each of the three soups were in a tiny espresso cup.  My salmon was no better than what I get at Texas roadhouse but it was three times the price.  I would definitely not recommended this place.  If you want a fancy, awesome meal go to Houston's!  The one thing that was great were the rolls (they were free too)!  Don't get me wrong the food is good but not worth the price tag!  You can get just as good food a lot of other places for a lot cheaper!",low

"This studio is probably the best hot yoga studio I have been to. I went there several times a week for about a month over the summer and enjoyed it every time. I love the music they play and I love that the teachers are knowledgeable and motivational. I really got a great workout while going. The space is clean and even smells good....that's pretty awesome for a hot yoga studio. I like that they have wood floors...it makes me feel like they can keep it cleaner and it's easier to balance on. The reason why I knocked it to 4 stars is because it is simply unaffordable. I have a fairly good job, but I don't think I could afford to keep going. If this place was reasonably priced, it would definitely get 5 stars from me.",low
"Had a fabulous time here with my husband celebrating my birthday last weekend. We both got ""The Farmer's Feast"" and it was truly amazing. I was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food (though the hubby didn't really share too much). I highly recommend this option for anyone dining here. 

The antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses. Next, I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet. Strawberries, arugula, radishes, yum! For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam. His dish was amazing, I had to fight for a couple bites. For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious. The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet. I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy. For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef... just lucky we each got our favorite meats. Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves. For dessert, I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing. One of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy. The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey. Just fantastic. The hubby got bread pudding which we didn't much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didn't try. I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option. Also, it ended up that you got a half glass (at least) with each course so I think it is a good value (the wine pairing was an extra $45.) 

I do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt. There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much. However, I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef, I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes. Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all. Our server was extremely warm and friendly. She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her. She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together. Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow... however, I believe that this is intentional. They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself. With the Farmer's Feast in particular it took us almost 3 hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax. The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end (it is six courses after all!) or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next. I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine. It was pure food heaven. This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event; when you come here, this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough!  We truly had fantastic night here.

One warning I will say is for ladies, you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels (I had been warned so had wedges). In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting. Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite ""special occasion"" restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two. My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times (you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out) but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease. It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber.",high
"If it's an emergency, they will generally see you asap.  When we used to live in Desert Ridge, we had 2 dogs, 2 cats, there were times when I needed a vet immediately, and generally they will accommodate you in such a demise.  They see you pretty efficiently, but of course they will suggest things that I feel are not merited to add onto a bill, but it's your right to question their additions and refuse, of course.  I've never found them to be arrogant or pushy, they will easily offer other options, or be ok with your decision.

During 1 extremely difficult period with our beloved Rottie/Sheppard Mix, they were very understanding to the emotional distress we were experiencing with regards to his advancing old age - he was 17.  They were happy to provided us with care during his aging.  Sadly, it came to a point that his quality of life was no longer conducive to allowing him to continue in the state he was, and it when it came to making the horrible and very sad decision to allow them to put him down, the entire staff were so understanding, caring, and totally sympathetic to our demise.  They allowed us to hold him, cradle him and pet him the whole time.  We were allowed as much time as we wanted before, during and after the whole life-altering circumstance.  They even sent us a sympathy card, signed by all the staff, after the terrible ordeal we went through.

During another trying experience we had to endure, our boxer mix was attacked by another dog and needed emergency care.  We were now closer, and under the care of the Tatum/Shea location, but they were unable to see us.  This location was able to open up their schedule to see us under this distressing circumstance.  They provided expert care and glad to say that he mended just fine, with no lasting ill-effects.",high

"At first I was happy to find a dry cleaning shop that was on my route to/from work and had good prices.  The whole pay in advance thing and only accepting cash or debit card (with a 50 cent charge for debit) was a litte inconvenient, but that was OK.  The first few batches of items I brought in came out great, but then the quality started to go downhill.  I finally gave up on this place when 3 separate batches of items I brought in came back wrinkled, like they were not pressed completely.  Even the simple items like pencil skirts looked like they hadn't been touched at all.  Huh?  A low price is not really a bargain if I have to iron everything again myself once I get home.

"I stayed here in March'10 and thought the place was alright, nothing to rave about but here was my experience:
PROS:
1.  Location was good for what I was there for (work)
2.  The nightly rates were really cheap (this had to do with my company more than the establishment though)
3.  Easy enough drive to/from the airport
4.  You can almost bypass Phoenix altogether getting to Scottsdale.
5.  Their was plenty of shopping places about a mile and a half up the road (think Best Buy, Target, McDonalds, etc...)
6.  A pretty happening restaurant/bar up the street that gets two thumbs-up
7.  The rooms were actually really spacious and nice...it was like having a luxury one bedroom apartment scaled down for size (full kitchen, massive bathroom, den seating area & king size bed in a comfortably sized room).
8.  Hot tub was rockin' & nobody gave us a hard time about having glass bottles out there.
CONS:
1.  Once I checked in, I had to lug a ton of stuff over to a room in the one of the back buildings and I couldn't see my rental car (maybe I'm weird...but I like to have my car close by)
2.  I unpacked and got situated to find that the internet in my room wasn't working (Must have!), called the front office and they had to move me to an entirely different room (mind you I just unpacked...AGH!)
3.  I ate dinner a couple times with co-workers in their lounge, & while it was good...it wasn't great, so we all ate at the restaurant/bar up the street the rest of the time.
4.  Be aware, you stand a decent chance of see spiders looming around...so you have been warned, but otherwise it's real clean.

I'd stay here again pending that I got the same room rates that I did last time, but it's my understanding having talked to the girls at the front desk that we got booked at unusually low rates.

"Firesky Resort is a marvelous place to unwind and enjoy the warm dry evening air and fire-lit torches.  Whenever I have the opportunity to stay in the Kimpton Hotel Group's locations, I always know I've made the right choice.  The hotel was beautiful, hip and inviting.  

I gave them three stars because the rooms were a nice, but not fabulous, the amenities of L'occitane products definitely helped.  The restaurant Taggio was fine, wasn't spectacular and definitely was the part of the hotel which was least memorable.  

The staff was friendly and helpful.  I'd stay here again, but with the expectation of enjoying the wonderful pool/cabana area and leaving the resort for dinner.  Scottsdale has so much to offer, what was I thinking....",low

"Having been to about ten 24 Hour Fitness locations here and in California, this location is probably one of the least impressive.  

While the staff is friendly and the gym itself is clean, the facility is small and on only one floor (note that it is a 24 Hour Active, not a 24 Hour Sport), and has an industrial feel - like it used to be an old Costco.

"One hour. That is how long we waited after ordering before we decided we would rather eat anywhere that wasn't here. A crushing, impressively underwhelming experience in lack of service.

We arrived, found we had free valet parking? With a teensy parking lot, this works, thank you. A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating? Also a plus. Setting expectations and/or taking care of waiting customers? FAIL.

On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here (tho we entered Rockerij). We asked to be re-seated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud, conversation intruding, music. We were reseated by the fireplace, and a waiter came over shortly to take our order. Bam. So far so good...or so we thought. 30 Mins after placing our order, I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered (exactly)...so we think it is being taken care of. 40 MINS after placing our order, I have still only had my coffee refilled once...and had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again, because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous ""drive-by"" waiter never returned. A few mins beyond that, this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer. Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of: 

""I don't know why it's taking so long...""
and
""I put the ticket in right after I took your order...""

So...as a waiter...maybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say...15mins after bringing it by the kitchen? Perchance? What do you think?

FIFTEEN (15 == few?) minutes later, we still had no food and I'd had quite enough. Out the door we went.

On a comical note: As we were outside (another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem?) our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if we'd like to come back inside?

It seems that we are not alone in this. Courtney W.'s review (10/14/12) is representative of what we experienced.

I am dumbfounded how they have any good reviews. There must be a serious drought of sit down restaurants in this part of town, because this crap would never fly where I live. I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.

P.S. They own 3 restaurants apparently: Richardson's, Rokerij, and Dick's Hideaway...all right in the same area (Rokerij and Richardson's being attached). 

P.P.S. They all serve the same menu. It is NOT amazing. I have previously been to Dick's. Yes, it is good. No my socks did not come flying off.

P.P.P.S. ProTip: Drive down to Central Phoenix and go to Durant's, Portland's, Switch, or Fez. All of these places have exemplary service and food to match.",low

"four star average?
Why?
This place is a chain restaurant with a silly name - the family made me eat here and I will tell you this - the only thing four star here are the sexy tall young fit waiters.... everything else is weak and salty...

At least they serve bourbon - but seriously the cocktail menu was silly and the preparation by the untrained bartenders was obvious - silly rolls with honey butter oh that's cute -

the food was applebees meets outback  - one of those taste of the world menus - my dad was silly enough to order the prime rib - it looked like a swanson frozen dinner - poor dad - IT IS CALLED WHITE CHOCOLATE GRILL - what does that mean - oh it means we are silly and have duped people into thinking we are a trendy restaurant.

So sad - seriously the service is lovely and attentive the food is better prepared and home with more flavor and less salt - i guess the real french fries - the string kind were yummy but I needed to up my BP meds.

oh and a funny decor thing - they use rolled up, stacked utensils in napkins as sorta sculptural decor around the restaurant - sorta weird",high

"I'm going to be an uptight stickler here, and only review the pizzeria portion of LGO since the grocery part can be done under as a separate business. I hope others follow suit. Sorry, I'm super nerdy about this stuff.

Anyways, the sourdough crust is my favorite pizza crust in all the land. I love the flavor and how it's always glistening with oil when it comes to the table. The toppings are really special here. If you even remotely like avocado, get their avocado pizza. The lemon zest puts it over the top. The corn with goat cheese is my next favorite. The only one that I haven't liked is the the rocket man. It tasted fine, but the heavy toppings were too much for the thin crust.

We also had the fortune of trying their grilled artichoke appetizer one evening. I couldn't get enough of it! It's not on the menu (seasonal item I'm sure), but we asked about it when we saw plates of it go by.

Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines. Any time I can get a decent bottle at a restaurant for under $20, I'm a happy camper.",high
"Decent menu which includes the traditional satay, tom yum koong, curries, pad thai etc. What threw me off was teriyaki, sweet and sour chicken, kung pao, chow mein. Food is good with great portions! Careful on the heat scale. 10 is blazin...
Weird thing....I was really thirsty after the meal. Usually that's the result of using the other type of SaLt. 
Overall the place is clean, modern, and staff are attentive. Curries are 10 bones, Fried rice at 9, and most entrees at 9 bones! Price is a buck plus more than our So Cal places. Give it a try, food is good, and service is fast.

"Stopped in for some macaroons and coffee, the food and coffee were decent. The place itself was kinda dirty, stains on the floor, saw a couple of flies, and sat in an uneven chair.",high
"Where to start???

The owners are very kind... say hi to Benny in the kitchen!!!

My wife and I found this place while living in the culinary-void NW Valley of Phoenix, and we have eaten here probably 50 times over a 3-year period.  Everything is good:

Gryos
Chicken Pita
Souvlaki
Greek Salads are probably one of the best salads that we have ever eaten
Fries are always fresh
Zatsiki sauce is stellar

The atmosphere is a bit void, but people don't come to 35th and Thunderbird for the atmosphere...  they come for great food at a great price.",high
Consistently a good experience.  Not a fancy place by any means but a great neighborhood restaurant with friendly staff and good food.,high
"Was here for a KYOT Wine-Down-Wednesday event a couple of years ago.  The bar area was packed.  Stood around waiting for a table to open up- very uncomfortable as the area is pretty small.  

I remember trying the New England clam chowder.  Tasty, but it had too much potatoes and not enough clams.  Had something else, but can't recall which, and the current menu online reflects a few changes.  

I do recall thinking I would like to come back and have lunch or dinner there, so I'm giving it three stars.",high
"CARLOS O'BRIENS IS MEXICAN FOOD!  Sorry for yelling but I nearly dropped my phone when I started reading reviews from people expecting Irish fare.

I've been eating at Carlos for 22 years or so.  I remember being quite young going to the 12th Street and Northern Location.

They have, hands-down, the best Pollo Fundito Chimi I have ever eaten, and boy have I eaten my fair share.  5 stars

Their chips and salsa are also always fresh.  The chips get also 5 stars.  Always fresh and hot.  

Their mild salsa is very mild and watery.  Not my style but it fresh.  I mix the hot in with the mild which works form me.

Shredded beef tacos are also 5 stars.  Love 'em.

Fried ice cream is also yummy.  I'm not a desert guy so I won't attach stars to them but yum yum.

Other tips are to come at happy hour.  Good deals.  Lunch specials and portions are just right also.

Carlos O'Brien's is a great place that just gives me comfort knowing that it is there when I need it.  I spend so much time trying new places, especially mexican, that this old favorite tends to get skipped because the closest one is 15 miles from the house.

Why only 4 stars?  Only because there are more authentic places like Los Dos and Rosita's Place that get 5.

I'll be back.  I always will.  Next time sooner than later.  That darn Fundito calls my name.",high
"We were in Phoenix this past weekend for a wedding and wanted a low key, fun, yummy mexican feast before heading for a night out on the town.

Los Sombreros was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel and it was great!  We sat on the adorable, sparkly light-lit patio and stayed warm with the help of two heaters.  The place was pretty busy but not too loud.  The margaritas were huge and strong as can be and made just the way we liked em!  We shared an order of guacamole - i was slightly disappointed since other yelpers RAVED about it - i thought it was pretty standard, a little better than ""just OK"".  Both of us ordrerd the chilaquiles (he shrimp, me chicken) and they were fantastic although it would have been great  if our server told us that each dish was a legit 10 lbs! We EASILY could have split!

we had such a fun time, the service was good, food was good and the patio was a great backdrop for a casual, albeit fairly romantic meal.",high
"I'm pretty sure that Palee's Crown is the best Thai place I have ever been to. The service is always great, and the Owner comes out to talk to us whenever we are there.
The food is so amazing, I have never tried something that I disliked at all. I especially love the Pad Thai and the Currys. I am always full and completely satisfied by the time I leave. I also recommend trying the Thai Iced Tea to drink if you are like me and enjoy weird authentic drinks, and for dessert be sure to get the coconut ice cream. Don't make excuses about trying to spend less money or that you are being careful about what you're eating, just try it.
The prices are good and if you're not sure what to try, stick with a curry but remember that Asian spices are very distinct, and very spicy.",high
"Very clean with and old fashion cinema atmosphere. Snacks are very expensive so if popcorn and soda are a must for you, expect to spend alot of money. The amazing reclining seats are worth it though. I definitly recomend Cinemark 16 as the place to go to watch movies! 
   Also there are alot of great eating places next to it or within walking distance to do the dinner  and movie date night!",high
"We had a great first visit here for brunch.  They have a creative brunch menu with traditional breakfast items with a twist, lunch items, and great-sounding desserts.  Our party had the sunflower salad, bacon and eggs, steak and eggs, the hummus platter, and the sweet potato chips.  Everything was quite good and very fresh.  We really enjoyed the sweet potato chips - not greasy at all, just sweet potato flavor with a hint of seasoning.  We'll be back to try some of the other menu items.  

Great atmosphere and pretty small dining room which makes it quaint and cozy.  Unfortunately we had the table right next to the kitchen doors which was the only unpleasant part.  Bussers and waiters would come flying out of the kitchen and then stand inches away from me with load trays of food trying to figure out what table they were going to.  The water refiller seemed especially hungover as he literally stood next to my arm for 3 minutes trying to figure out who needed water.  They should put a divider between that table and the kitchen.  Also bar service was slow - 15 minute wait for 2 mimosas.  Waiter apologized but still...

overall a good experience.  Big fan of the atmosphere and menu.  Can step up the service a bit.",high
This place is home.,high
"Zipps is a rocking place with TV screens in all viewable angles. The atmosphere is great and this place really packs it in on game nights like Monday Night Football. Smoking is outside because this place is around the Tempe border. The service is great and the food is even better. Try the chicken tacos!
Good times had by all!
Check it out some time!",high
"Kashman's has great food but you really have to gear yourself up for the rude owner (artichoke lady) and some of the mean, crotchety ladies that work behind the counter. 
This is not a good place to place your order by phone. They're always nasty and short with you on the phone and then when you pick your order up, they get all bent out of shape because you have no place to stand and wait for your order. 
The guys and gals that bus are usually super efficient and very friendly and the food is above average. If you're looking for good food and a verbal lashing from the staff that work there, then Kashman's is your place to eat!!",high

"We had a fun, early dinner on the patio here at BoomBozz.  The advertised happy hour specials appeared to be a very good value; my fave was the soft pretzels & cheese.  I also had the wedge salad and it was excellent - they don't skimp on the blue cheese!  My son had the pepperoni pizza and even his discriminating palate was very happy.  A crisp blonde draft (for me) and ice cream (for him) polished us off and we left full & happy.",low
"I LOVE PITA JUNGLE! Why aren't they in Chicago?! Damn this unhealthy meat-lovin city! Let's try something different...

Anything I've had here was remarkable, and I've tried a couple of different Phoenix-based locations, so they're doing something right. Try the jalapeño hummus for a great spin to a Greek dish, and if you're really hungry, I highly recommend any of their lavosh pizzas. My favorite though? The Chipotle Chicken Lavosh Pizza, of course! It is delicious and mouth-watering.

I deduct 1 star solely for the fact that their parking lot is VERY inconvenient and way too crowded.",high
"Good Whole Foods location overall... The workers are very nice and attentive, and the food selection is good! Not the biggest Whole Foods I've ever been to, though.",low
"Summary: not impressed.

Arrived early afternoon, ironically maybe that was the problem - there wasn't enough going on, place was dead. I would have hoped that a restaurant manager would realize that the few customers they may have at a slow time are just as important as those on a Friday night rush - standards are standards, you either have them or you don't.

Waitress was pleasant but not attentive - with a total of 3 occupied tables had to get up and get her attention for more chips. Chips though were very good; needed hotter salsa.

My friend had the steak fajitas; tasted OK but just luke warm. Fajitas are supposed to be sizzling hot; duh.

I had a so-so tamale and chicken enchilada. Enchilada was just warm, mostly a flat layer of cheese. Tamale filling was tasty shredded meat (as it should be) but corn meal was barely warm and almost tasted only partially cooked. Refried beans weren't warm enough to even melt the grated cheese sprinkled on top, which consequently then pulled off in a single congealed mass when I took a bite. 

Finally, the Cadillac margaritas were just average at best. 

$50 plus tip for two meals plus two margaritas; not worth it.

The place looked promising and has a cute patio area but we won't be back - someone's not watching the store. I'm trying to be generous with the two stars as some other Yelpers seem to like this place; maybe things can get better.",high
"""You want a piece of me?"" said the gargantuan mango tango eggees cup. I said ""YES, I DO!"" and give me a big ol veggie samich and some fries to go with my brain freeze thank you very much. 

Todays order is same ol same ol 12 inch whole wheat extra veggie grinder with extra crispy fries and a bigee flavor (mango tango) $6.50 w/ the captain card. How can you beat this kind of scratch for two people. you cannot.

It was Yuuuummmmae!

"I was also roped in with a flier on my door, and ordered this a month or so ago when they had their deal for free cookies, salad, and drink with a pizza order.  Upon delivery, I was given another coupon for the same deal and a few weeks later received a handwritten thank you note for ordering with them and a coupon for a free order of cheesy bread, no purchase necessary.  Needless to say, this has become a go-to pizza option for me.  4 stars for food taste and quality, an extra for great service and good deals.
Salad is pretty average but good enough for me with a pizza, pizza is particularly good, cookies are awesome, cheesy bread is cheesy enough but not just a pile of melted cheese.  Their sauce is really tasty- tastes fresh and not too sweet.  Delivery is free, and on time.  The longest time I've been quoted for a pizza (at 7:00 on a Saturday) was 45 minutes, and they got there in 23 minutes (I wasn't timing them but I did notice how quick they got there).  They have a hot'n'ready special that's only a dollar more than Little Sleazer's and ten times better.  And if you don't think it's good, you get your money back.  So really, you should just try it.  Okay?  Okay.",high
"I so wanted to love this place. I'd heard great things about the food, love the concept and was looking forward to a wonderful experience. What a disappointment. 

We were seated within 20 minutes or so of arrival, which was great considering the crowd. It was nice to have somewhere to walk around, and we were able to serve ourselves tea and coffee while we waited. 

Once seated, however, it took 20 minutes for anyone to take our order, and another 45 for the food to come. Our food arrived cold. Husband and I both ordered eggs ""over medium;"" mine were runny and undercooked, his were hard and scaly. ""Home fries"" were a mound of mushy, under-seasoned potatoes. We were offered jam when the food came, but the waitress never returned with it. My husband asked one of the other staff if they had any jam, received a curt, ""yes"" as a reply, but they didn't offer to help in any way. 

For the prices (average $10 plus $2.25 for a self-serve drink), I can think of many places I'd rather spend my dining dollars. Yes, the grounds are lovely and I like that most of the food is from local suppliers (which does not mean it was raised on THIS farm, BTW), but there are many lovely patios in Phoenix with much better food and service.",high

"Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back!  

We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle!  Delicious!  I've always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous!

Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing.  I don't think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time!

Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle.  Best hand made pastas anywhere.  Perfect!

Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles!  So right...so full!  I'm so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey!

We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go!  What a perfect Italian dinner paradise!

We can't wait to go back for opera night...and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner.  Best in the valley.",high

"We stopped in here on a hot summer afternoon, grumpy because we had been on a wild goose chase for mint. Couldn't find it anywhere, like Fry's, Basha's, or TJ's, even in those teeny tiny overpriced little packages. They have it here in big bunches for something ridiculous like 59 cents. Since we had friends coming over for mojitos, this made me happy! It's just about mojito season again, so I'll be headed back to this location. The produce section was large and had some good-looking stuff in it. The location isn't really too scary.",high
"I decided to give this place a whirl yesterday on my lunch about 5pm from work  the space was nice open airy the staff from front of the house to The wait staff all were very friendly linens on the tables as well as linen napkins the only thing was the menu was a little lack luster the appetizer selection was fair. Hummus,tzatziki  , served w/flat bread ,selection of olives a couple of pork belly selections I had the lamb burger I ordered medium it was served a more rare but was still good the did offer some higher priced entrees and there were other selections of burgers and sandwiches thus the name gastro pub  they had some good beers on tap",high
"If you are looking for only raw vegan food, this is your place.  Nothing is cooked, everyhthing is 100% raw.

The dessert is yummy as well.  This is a must try!",high
"I cannot believe I am about to say this:
AIRPORT FOOD IS GOOD.

For any of you who eat in airports on a regular basis, you've surely come to accept the fact that airport food just sucks.  It doesn't matter how much you spend:  the bread is stale or soggy, meats are dry and tasteless, and forget fresh veggies and fruits of any quality.

I was just shocked when I visited the Roadhouse at Sky Harbor recently.  I had an hour before my flight so I ordered a Stella Artois and a french dip.  I wish I'd had a camera to catch my expression when I bit into my sandwich.  The bread was soft and warm.  The meat was tender and tasty.  The cheese was really good; no joke this was real cheese.  And HOT au jus?  

OMFG I almost freaked out it was so good!  I couldn't wait to tell my server how pleasantly surprised I was.  She kinda laughed at me and said they get compliments on their food all the time.  AT AN AIRPORT?  Folks, this is the best kept secret at Sky Harbor.  I will make it a point to go out of my way to eat there in the future, even if my gate is in another termial!!

This place is in the low B gates - try it and you won't regret it!",high
"This place is yummy. The service might not always be, but the food is. They have a sexy bar and great intimate decor and a South West feel that isn't done with terra cotta colored paint and teal cacti pictures. I love the Jelapeno Benedict and they have AMAZING margaritas. And they serve brunch till super late.",high

"Best time to work out at this gym is in the early morning.  Went in the afternoon a few times and it's usually packed.  

This place has everything I need to work out. (threadmill, free weights, machines, basketball court, swimming pool, and sauna).  Rarely do I see any of the machines out of order/ broken.  Although the men's sauna bench was broken for maybe 2-3 months before they finally fixed it.",low

Very kind manager working the day we called to see if we could bring our dog with us before we had to run off to her dog training. She said they don't normally allow pets out there, but since there was nobody outside, she would allow it unless someone complained. We got there, passed the pup over the gate, and had brinner like champs while watching the traffic. The manager came by to check on us and even brought out a bowl of water for Tatum. Like everyone says, it's Denny's food... what do you expect? But I think the hospitality makes all the difference.",high

Cho Dang - Fo Sho!  Looking for Korean food can be tricky.  Cho Dang offers my favorite entree cooked just right.  Tofu Soup w a fresh egg - yum!  Broth could be spicy but definitely worth the burnnnn....urrr!!!  Decor of the place - I dig!  Dark wood flooring with some picture frames of plants; then the ceiling is painted sky blue to give you that outdoor serene feel.  Service was great - my waiter was a young man that couldn't tell me what Hite beer taste like (told him to take a sip and let me know :) ) Shhhh...don't tell anyone.  Needless to say my dinner was delectable - definitely a return place - enjoy my friends!,high
"I've never been to a restaurant where we (a party of 6 with a reservation) sat at a cleared table with no water, no bread, no cutlery, no service for 15 minutes before receiving a menu .... when we finally had someone provide a menu, it then took another 15 minutes to get the wine we ordered. 
Still no bread, still no food. 

The server dumped the wine bottle on the table (unopened), and went to find glasses. 10 minutes later she then threw the bottle opener at our table so we could open the wine ourselves while she went to find glasses. Most (!?!) of the wine glasses arrived within the next 10 minutes, and still no bread or food. 
Do I need to go on? 

And while the server apologized profusely, she never offered to take anything off the bill or even a dessert on the house for our clearly disgruntled group. 

Food was fine -- the house-made burrata is quite remarkable. But not enough of a reason to return. Others we were with have had better experiences, and I would hope for the owner's sake that our dinner was an aberration...",high
"I hate giving this place two stars, but the service has always been inconsistent. I've been coming here since 2006, and the food has always been excellent. Service has been spotty though; during my most recent visit our server blew off two of our drink orders and I had to order from the bar myself. Honestly if they would hire some frumpy old veteran servers then I bet everything would improve ten fold. Anyone else ever had this problem?",high
"I had no idea they were open for lunch! Perfect since the boy and I were down town during lunch the other day. 

We stopped in around 2:30 inthe afternoon. No Wait! I couldn't even believe it. I hadn't eaten there since I was a little girl, but it was just as good as I remember.

We got a couple beers and split the Margarita Pizza. It was sooo yummy! Perfectly crispy on the edges and lots of flavor. The service was a tini bit slow, but no big deal, we loved it. 

If you want great pizza and dont want to wait the normal 3 hours during dinner, you should hit up Pizzaria Bianco while the sun is still up, less wait time if at all. 

Enjoy!!",high
"My mom and my son and I went to old town on a Thursday to check out some galleries and listen to some of the buskers! So after our perusing we stopped to get ice cream. 

Real ice cream! Petersen's is a really cool place and it's brand new! Just opened 11/23 I think. Well they have lots of great flavors like Georgia Peach, NY Black Cherry, Cappuccino, Peppermint with real peppermint, lots of sorbet, lots of chocolate stuff that I didn't want to try, and old favs like cookie dough, butter pecan etc. 

They also sell pints and also gallons I think! 

The staff is super cool and well educated about the history of the shop. I think the girl said they originated in Chicago and that the tiles in the ceiling are from the original location! I just thought that was so cool! She also said that they could sub the milk in your lattes and coffe with ice cream to make pepperment lattes and more wild flavors! I thought that was pretty rad. 

Anyway, if you are in old town I highly recomend you check this place out!",high
"I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, ""not too long."" We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began. 

Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours. 

After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time. 

I don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road.",low

Best steak I have ever eaten is at Ruth's Chris steakhouse. Comes to your table sizzling hot. Sides are sold individually but are pretty good. The deserts and appetizers are awesome.

"Ahhh... Zinc.  It's been a while since I have left Paris.  Being a resident and citizen there for so long, I would like to think I can spot a decent French fare.  I have now been to Zinc three times, every time I ordered something different, so far the food has not dissapointed as much as the prices have.  Wow.

Okay, okay, you have a spot in Scottdale, it's a nice little posh area with plenty of traffic, designer furniture and nick-nack and artsy stores that typically have things that would require your to take out a 2nd mortgage to afford those things that often just gather dust, one season at a time at home.  You would think someone on that strip would be the one to say, let's have reasonable prices.  Zinc is not one of those.

The restaurant has the name Bistro in it. They have folks dining out on the sidewalk, dining with noise and the occasional smell of BMW exausts...  That's beautiful and very Parisian, also very Bistro.  Here is a wake up call though... Bistros offer fares with decent prices, a prix fixe menu and simply good simple food.  

The prices were incredibly high for what you do get.  Unfortunately the charm of having an outdoor patio and serving fries in fake newspaper doesn't cut it.    The Steak Frites (a hanger steak w/ fries and a brandy sauce) is a French Bistro Classic, a staple if you will and that was the only thing that was fairly prices for what you get.  But if you knew how much those cuts are to get from a supplier, you'd be asking questions about the prices even then.

On two of those occasions we had cheese plates, it was more of a mix and match, you could pick from a few Chevres, Softs and hard cheeses,  they were incredibly small portions but the breads that came with the platter was very tasty, warm and fresh.  It is typically served with a ramkin of olives.

So overall, sounds like I am bashing this restaurant, I am not but I am dieing to find a reason to go back because there is something good about it, the atmosphere, the lighting, the seasonal menu.  But little things keep me from enjoying Zinc.  Such as the time we sat at the secluded back part of the restaurant, the small courtyard.  Very charming, though some of the waiters, and cooks smoked right outside of the courtyard's gates.  The smell of cheap cigarettes and mumbled chatter caused us to ask for another table, when we did, we were all the sudden looked as ""picky customers"".  

One more tip Zinc, you may want to get the mall janitor to move his trash can from the view of your utmost beatiful courtyard, such promise, undelivered due to tacky flaws that could have been prevented by an attentive manager or even a caring waite staff.

Don't miss:  Dining in the courtyard, or the sidewalk.

"I'm so happy this store is located so close to my house! Every time I come to this store I get great service. I mainly use this store to get food items for my dog or the grooming salon - where Zombi has never had a bad experience. This location also has a Banfield Vet Hospital, PetsHotel, Doggie Day Camp, Training services and at times has adoptions. My best friend has used both the PetsHotel and the Doggie Day Camp for her pooch and has never had a bad experience. I also used the Banfield Vet to get Zombi up-to-date on her Rabies and the Vet was super nice. The best part was that I didn't even have an appointment, I just walked in and they were able to fit me in after a five minute wait.

My only pet peeve (pun intended) is there is usually only one cashier working and the line can get pretty long. However, it doesn't take long for another employee to open up another line to speed up the check-out experience AND they usually show up on their own, without customers complaining about only having one cashier. Bonus!",high
"I always forget and tell people that Pomeroy's is on Central. I think it must just be that cool - I'm trying to pull it closer to the other really good places to go. It is, in fact, on 7th St. and if you tie it on a little tight, the grocery behind is, in fact, open late. 

It looks like a bar that should have a few regular bar flies and music that screeches to a halt when someone new walks in. And by that, I mean it's the most endearingly divey of bars.

There's shuffleboard, just give your id to the bartender in return for the pucks. There's pool, but you pay quarters for that. The juke box is electronic and you should expect that you're gonna hear Def Leppard at least once during the night. The regulars will help you learn darts, the food is griddle-fare and the guys behind the bar are always good for a chat or to grab you a pint. 

Pomeroy's should definitely be on your rotation of places to be in Phoenix.",high

"I love that walking through the doors of the Sugar Bowl is like taking a step back in time but what I don't love is that it looks like it hasn't been cleaned or had any restoration work done since the day it opened. Lets be honest though, I didn't come here for the decor, I came for the ice cream. 

I was very excited when I saw the sundae covered in chocolate, cherries and marshmallow creme. I love marshmallow creme and chocolate, always a recipe for success when these two ingredients are combined. Well, no luck. They were out of marshmallow creme. I got a brownie sundae instead, only ate half and decided that it was only ok. 

I probably won't go back to this place. There are too many good dessert options out there. Though if my friends insisted, I would more than likely oblige.",high

"Some of the best Italian food I have ever had. This is a favorite for my wife and I. Sima and Marcellino are very nice people, very inviting. The bar is small but fun to hang out at. The food is always fresh and delicious.

Watch out for Marcellino - he likes to push the truffles.",high
"What a restaurant! Absolutely loved my experience at Tarbells. I've been hearing rave reviews for quite sometime and decided to try it out recently. My party and I sat at the bar, which was a great choice because the bar was comfortable, rather large and really social and fun. The bartender (young woman) was fabulous, inviting and very nice! She was very attentive. A guest in my party dines at Tarbells often and she had his drink in front of him by the time we walked to the end of the bar.....Now thats some customer service for ya!

Food = We started with the Calamari. A favorite dish of mine and this one was outstanding. Two very different but delicious dipping sauces. A roasted red pepper and a pesto mix. Not sure which one I liked more :) I enjoyed the pan-seared jumbo sea scallops. TO DIE FOR. I am a huge scallop fan and these were done just right. Caramelized, giving them the right amount a sweet....and it was served over very yummy risotto. Another dish enjoyed by my party was the Fennel Sausage Pasta dish, the fennel sausage was AMAZING. 

Overall experience was fantastic, as soon as I get another opportunity I will be dining here again! :)",high
"NOTE:  I only had take-out, and it was brought to me by my boss.  She rules!
She got me a hummus/grilled/marinated chicken combo.  It has 3 different hummus...es...es (HA!): roasted red pepper, jalapeno and plain ole' hummus.  They are sectioned off in the big plastic container, which rules for my OCD, as I don't like my food touching.  In the center is a PILE (a total monton!) of grilled chicken.  It's got some sort or spicy rub on it, but not too much kick.  It had been marinated, too.  And tender....I think this is the most tender chicken I have ever had.  It made my own tender spots as juicy as the chicken was!
I'm not big on pita, so instead she got me a side of cukes.  
This thing weighs a ton and I've been eating it for 2 hours.  I have made a mess in my ""Make me Yelp"" boyshorts.",high

Only problem for me is that I live in Scottsdale and frequent the Scottsdale Public Library, therefore I want my tax dollars to go into Scottsdale's coffers so I will try to do most of my shopping and dining across the street at the Scottsdale Quarter (except for Zinc Bistro - I'll keep going to Zinc regardless of what zip code it's in).",low
"So I'm torn on how to rate this place star-wise because honestly, there were a few things that were 10 stars and there were a few things that were 1 star. So let me break it down for you. We walked in to this cool little spot on the Sunday before Memorial Day and it was about half full. It looked like it was VERY groovy but I seriously had to use my phone to walk around because it was SO dark. We sat at the bar and not one of the bartenders addressed us for like 15 minutes. Maybe they couldn't see us? Anyhoo the wine list is interesting and I was having a hard time choosing something. The one bartender that finally waited on us had NO personality. I asked for a taste of a few things they had by the glass. They sounded very interesting but I had never heard of quite a few of them and I pride myself on knowing my wine. The first one I tried was a syrah blend that had something to do with chocolate and it was just that...too chocolatey. My friend ordered a glass of the Justin Cabernet which is always a safe bet. I then asked for the Tannat they had by the glass. It was awful. It taste like it had been opened for days. I told our personality challenged bartender and he went and tattled on us to maybe the manager? The manager then came over and was pleasant if a bit condescending at first. He said ""well have you ever had a Tannat? and I said ""actually, all the time, I know what they're about and that is no Tannat"" he then did agree with me and said ""just tell me what you're looking for"" I told him I wanted a Cabernet Franc or Grenache which they didn't have either by the glass. He ended up pouring me something that really was delicious. He definitely redeemed the evening because he was professional and helpful. We then ordered the flatbread with pesto and a few different cheeses and it was seriously one of the better flatbreads I've ever had. They had two guys playing live music and they were very good. So my break down is:
Atmosphere - 4
Attitude - 1 except for the knowledgeable bartender, he gets a 10
Flatbread - 10
QPR - 10...for those non-winey's this is quality price ratio",high
"Best cajun food in town, not just from a truck.  Phoenix doesn't have the greatest selection of cajun offerings so I was amazed at Food Truck Friday to find Jamburrito.  They have a pretty stellar selection of meats & meals considering it's from a truck.

The spices were perfect - just spicy enough to enjoy but nothing that's going to harm.  I had the catfish once and the jamburrito twice... not in one sitting because the portions are VERY filling.",high
"Planet Sub is definitely a good option for solid, good tasting subs. I'm next door at Gangplank a couple times a week and we usually hit this place up for lunch. It's much better than the last place that was in this spot, has tons of options (we decided you could eat lunch there for a month and not have the same sandwich), and friendly staff. I'm definitely glad they put this in. It's a great option in the downtown Chandler area.",high
"Great service, atmosphere and of course great food. My wife and I decided on Blue 32 last night for dinner. We have been there many times, but we felt we needed to share our experience.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar having a few drinks and visiting other patrons. Around 9:50 we realized the kitchen would be closing. I asked Daniel and Baeley the bartenders what time the kitchen served ""dinners"" of course he stated 10:00pm ""OOPS"". But Daniel said they would prepare what ever we wanted.  I asked him to check to see if they have already started to clean up first. We do not like to ask the kitchen staff to prepare dinner if they had already began or completed clean up. Daniel returned to say that yes they had finished the grill, but he again repeated that they would still prepare anything we wanted. At that time we declined to have the kitchen staff prepare anything. But a moment later, Roman the chef came up to us and sincerely stated that he would be more than pleased to prepare whatever we wanted. Still we were not wanting to make such a request  that late, but with his sincere and friendly personality he still insisted that they were more than willing.  So we asked him to pick  and prepare something of his choice which turned out to be the best two burgers that we have enjoyed in a long time, a Bacon Cheese Burger and his speciality Texan Jalapeno  Burger both with extra crispy bacon just the way we like it. SOOOOO....we would highly recommend Blue 32 and it's staff including by name, Roman the chef and Daniel and Baeley the bartenders.  Every time we have gone to Blue 32 we have had nothing but a great experience, this place is a must!!!",high

"I have completed this run (obviously not the 27th annual edition) 5 times now. The course is always the same - a bit hillier than other Papgo courses as it takes a right along the sidewalk behind the zoo, but the organization is always excellent. The t-shirt is another good draw to this event - a long sleeve shirt that changes color in the sun. There is always food at the end, a raffle, and a great crowd. One of the best events on the racing calendar each year and an excellent way to start the new year off right!",high
"I found this place based on Yelp reviews so I feel obligated to add one more 5 star review to the mix. I needed to get a chain fixed on my bike and was not looking to spend a ton of money or hours trying to fix it myself. So I stopped by and had them take a look at it. 

They recommended a full tuneup to keep it in tip top shape and spent the time explaining and demonstrating why it is deserving of spending money beyond the chain repair.  I ended up passing but didn't feel like they were trying to take advantage of me. Since it was close to closing time I left the bike with them overnight and got a call late in the morning the next day for pickup. It has been as good as new ever since. 

Having my fair share of riding in the Valley of the Sun I'm sure I'll be back soon for some inter-tubes or a spare part for whatever craigslist bike I happen to be riding around at the time.

Protip: Check out the unique bike artwork they have around the place. Also they have a small BMX (?) track in their ""backyard"" you can ride around and do jumps on anytime.",high

"Combination chicken fast food joint and gas station? Yessss! It's so convenient when I need to fill my car and my stomach! Joking aside this Popeye's isn't bad. Pretty much what you expect if you like their chicken. All of the workers seem really nice here too, they normally let you know if they have any specials but I would be sure to ask them just in case. And while you're waiting for your food you can just pop in the gas station store (they're connected). If not, they also have a drive-thru.",high
"So I am not usually in the Tempe area, but a friend told me about this place. So I though I would go try it out. I got a Grande Latte that was around $4. Not a bad price. But what made it worth it was that I guess this Friday I went was a Free Shot Friday. So I got an extra Espresso shot in my latte making it a triple for $4 bucks...no that is a deal. Not sure if they always have the promotion on Fridays. But it sure did make my morning a little better.

Their menu is very easy to read and give those no too educated in the was of coffee a good description of what each drink is and how it is made.

The had a ton of great looking pastries even though I didn't sample any. Cakes, Eclairs, Scones, and I think even what looked like cheesecake. 

The decor was very interesting. An old fashion coffee house meets a gypsy vibe. I think they have Wifi too. I saw a few people on there computers.

The service was a little slow I think. Felt like I was waiting for my drink for 10 minutes and the place was not really that busy. This was probably because of the guy ahead of me when I walked in who had about 7 different modifications to his drink. I have worked in a coffee place and those people are kind of annoying. So I will let them slide on the time of service.

Overall a great experience. Would have been 3 stars, but when you get something for free, in my book that is an automatically another star.",high
"I've known my way around Sky Harbor Airport since I was 4 years old and Terminal 1 was an actual terminal. In the time since then, their attempts to improve the airport, transportation and parking, and terminals have made it extremely confusing. Get in the wrong lane and you'll end up in the parking garage, when all you wanted was to drop off someone at the Departures curb. 

Terminal 2 remains the most accessible, with a parking lot located across the street and few airlines stationed there. Because only a couple airlines now use this terminal, security is a breeze. However, it's the oldest terminal, smells bad (like rotten pizza) and doesn't appear clean. 

Terminal 3 a little more of a hassle, although they have a parking garage attached to the terminal allowing you to enter any level through the elevator. More airlines use this terminal and it's much smaller than Terminal 4, making it easier to navigate.

Oh, Terminal 4. You're so nice, new and clean. You have access to great restaurants like Flo's Shanghai Cafe, Einstein's, Quizno's and more. I love Taberna del Tequila for a drink just prior to my flight inside security access (I don't like to fly, I prefer a bloody mary prior to boarding). You have tons of shops from Borders Books to local AZ tourist junk. I would like to love you, but you are just a mess. It's way to difficult to navigate your lanes to get where you're going, pick up and drop off is dangerous due to the people who pull away from the curb into lanes without looking, and security is painful- not only is there always a LONG line, but TSA agents regularly yell at people to ""pay attention!"" I dread flying out of Terminal 4 because I have to leave extra early for all the BS.

There are much easier airports to navigate and use, but we're stuck with Sky Harbor. I can only hope the light rail access once complete will help in making it a more user friendly airport.",high
"I've always sorta had mixed feelings about this theater. On the one hand, there aren't a whole lot of options to see independent film in AZ besides this place and Camelview, so I've got thank Dan Harkins for those outlets. On the other hand, there are times when this theater plays the SAME movie for weeks. An examples of this was with What The Bleep Do We Know?. I hate it when this place does that, but it's nice to see films here that wouldn't normally get play at Camelview (ie. Che: Parts 1 & 2, Let The Right One In, etc.).

In all, this place is a bit like my own Cinema Paradiso because I have so many fond memories in this theater. There was a Pulp Fiction screening when I was in high school and I got to go to an advanced screening of Slumdog Millionaire and actually got to meet Danny Boyle when he showed up for a Q&A afterward. I just wish they had midnight screenings of classic/grindhouse/cult films like The New Beverly in LA.",high
"If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But, I'm not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote ""family style"".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served ""family style"" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was ""this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties"".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It would've taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!",low

They were cooked to crisp perfection and lightly seasoned and still had the incredible sweet potato taste. I got to try the clasic delux burger itself and it was quite amazing, incredibly juicy and cooked just how i like it. We also got the lightly seasoned original fries as well which were just as good as the sweet potato ones. i also got to try the turkey burger which was also juicy and flavorful, along with the chicken panini which was incredibly tasty.  it was a great lunch every one i was with enjoyed themselves and I am glad my friend recommended it.",high

"Foothills Park in North Glendale, AZ is a more than just a dog park!!!  This park has a skate park, an aquatic center / fitness center, baseball/softball fields and a branch of the Glendale Public Library.

On the north side of the park is the Foothills branch of the Glendale Public Library. Here in 2011 this branch has started closing earlier a couple days a week and they are now closed on Thursdays and Sundays. You can still request books online to be transferred to this branch for your convenience.

The dog park was recently expanded with a new section of dog run that connects the front of the park on 57th Ave with the back of the park behind the library.  Parts of the dog park are closed a day a week for maintenance, but part of the park is open every day.

The baseball fields are the area of the park I use the most. Arrowhead Little League (www.ArrowheadLL.com) is based at this park and they play two seasons - Spring and Fall. The City of Glendale also runs baseball and softball programs at this park.  

A playground sits on the South side of the baseball fields, just North of the wash.

The Aquatic Center (www.glendaleaz.com/foothillscenter/) has an outdoor pool with slides and lap pools.  There's a fitness center indoors with all the equipment of a normal gym plus a rock climbing wall and full indoor basketball court.  The kids love to hang out at the rec center.

They have a great one dollar tag sale on Mondays which is pure bliss I tell you!! Having a tough week, head over to Savers with a 20 dollar bill on Monday and you will come out a new woman with a new wardrobe!! 

My mother is the one who actually got me hooked on this deal lol.. The original frugality of the family lol. 

Overall, I cannot give this thrift store five stars just because I am a thrift store whore and have visited about every thrift store in and around the Phoenix area and have plenty of experience with many other thrift stores. 

This Savers requires a lot of digging, but some of my best finds have been a Dooney and Bourke gently used wallet for $16.00. Banana Republic black sling shoes for $5.99. Brand name NEW work out clothes and plenty of NEW with tags vintage dresses all under $9.99.

Also we went on a friday night and probably because of the small area it got very loud, which I know the management has no control over, but just an fyi of my experience.

As a die-hard burger man, this is my default stop.  It is close to the house, in a pleasant shopping center, and has the best burger I've ever eaten in Phoenix.  I'd give it an extra half star if Yelp would let me.  This place is that good!",high
"I've now been to the WCG twice.  The first time I went, I only had a salad.  Only salad has new meaning here as they have some fantastic salads.  In fact, several people at the table said they had never had a salad so wonderful.  I also heard that the seared Ahi was to die for.  Salads were just filler as prelude to desert however.  Everyone at the table ordered something different and they were all passed around.  I can highly recommend the cheesecake and the banana pudding.  Both were outstanding.

On my second visit I tried the Parmesan crusted filet.  It was to die for and I ate way more of it than intended.  I also enjoyed the mashed potatoes and shared someone else's honey roasted carrots.  Tablemates had ribs and the steak sandwich and both had rave reviews.

Overall the service was wonderful, the atmosphere is relaxing and reasonably quiet even when the place is busy.  The food is excellent (I have not heard a bad thing about any dish) and the dessert is worth the trip.  They even list it first on the menu; a sure sign of something great!",high

"My girlfriend and I were hungry and wanted to try something new, so we hopped on the netbook and fired up Yelp. We tried Crazy Jim's, and boy was this a good pick. When we 1st rolled up to CJ's my girl was like ""I don't know about this!!!"" I said ""lets just go in and take a look, if it is clean inside then lets try it"". Once inside the place was small but quaint and most important it was CLEAN. So I ordered a veggie pita and got the pasta salad as a side. The food was ready pretty fast and I had envisioned something like a sandwich that you pickup and eat but it was all laid out over my plate. The pita was very good and I give a big thumbs up to, the pasta salad was kinda plain. My girl has a greek salad and she liked it but wasn't too crazy about the dressing. I would definitely go back to Crazy Jim's and eat. As a matter of fact anytime I am craving that veggie pita, your boy ""E"" will come to visit.

"My husband took me here on a Friday night ...after hearing good things about it from coworkers.

We sat on the patio which had plenty of misters and overlooked a park, it was a very relaxing environment.

Our server, Carla, was as cute as could be and was so nice the entire evening. She was one of the most attentive servers that I have had in a long time. She was so genuine and really added to the experience that we had here...thank you Carla !!!

We ordered a bottle of red wine that the husband picked, I am not sure what it was but it was damn good ($23 for the bottle). As an appetizer we had the Piatto Misto, which was an assortment of Italian meats, cheeses, olives , and breadsticks ($14) and this is definetly enough for 2-3 people. The meats were excellent and the cheese was tasty also. My only recommendation would be for them to not cut the cheese into tiny little cubes...that was odd because the meat was sliced and you could not incorporate it very well.

For dinner we shared a pizza.. The Sofia..it had Scamorza (Smoked Mozzarella),Parma Prosciutto,Parmigiano Reggiano ($13). It was ooh soo tasty. We could not eat the whole thing...there was like 3 pieces that we ended up having boxed up.

Then we had dessert.....I am still in heaven just thinking about this dessert. It was the Dolce Della Casa...Slightly Charred Sweet Calzone
filled with Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce and Banana topped with Vanilla Ice Cream...OOOOOhhh my God. This was by far the best dessert that I have had in a while. It was so gratifying...I had goosebumps after the first bite. I would recommend ordering a small and sharing it because it was huge ($7). I can die a happy woman after that dessert...and if this was a first date ...that would have been a guarantee for sex !!! 

The community here in Verrado was absolutely amazing, I wish I would have known about this neighborhood before I bought my house in Goodyear. If you live nearby I would recommend checking this place out and spending time looking around the  neighborhood.",high
"Kristi's review said, ""Great romantic spot to bring a date. Secures that you will be getting action later, trust me."" Well, that's good enough for me. And before the Yelp paparazzi shows up to muckrack... no I didn't take Kristi to Cheuvront's. I know better than that - I only hang with Kristi at dive bars. 

So I did take my lovely date to Cheuvronts. The decor and ambiance - think wide open and urban and dark without being too dark. It really set a mood. We ordered a bottle of wine from a fantastic list, along with a cheese plate and a pate plate. We had them select the cheeses to pair with the wine we had chosen with a few instructions as to cheese preferences. They have a selection of pates as well, and we had them choose similarly.

The cheese plate contained three cheeses, all superb. It was served with (good!) bread, some nuts, and some dried cranberries. The two pate plate was similarly served with bread and dark, delicious mustard. The pates were fantastic - the cheese plate and pate plate seemed destined to be served together. 

The food and drink were great, the service a little spotty especially since there weren't that many people in there. I'm guessing the waitress just didn't want use to feel like she was bothering us. After taking our time to enjoy the wine, cheese, and pate, we were both feeling full with no room for even dessert. 

Overall, a great meal, my date thought it was one of the best places she had ever been to, and I'm clearly going to have to pay more attention to Kristi's reviews.",high

I love a great Chimichanga along with  re-fried beans and ordered a much  needed strawberry  Margareta.  So lovely!!!! I enjoyed everything on my plate!

 I Loved it so much I suggested we come back my last night in town for drinks and appetizers.
We decided to order the  Mini Chimi Sampler, Macayo's Famous Cheese Crisp that I ordered with ground beef (it almost looked like a cheese crisp pizza),Guacamole Dip with chips. They also offer free salsa and chips every time you arrive.

There's no real creativity (except for the disco balls during ""happy birthday"", seriously, uh yes) and it's fairly generic fare.

"what can I say about Glam... well, i really, really despise it. Every time I go there, I regret the decision. And in my grandiose style, I'm going to say why in a list:

1) Cash only!! But listen to this, the bartender will take your debit card, charge you a fee, and give you cash, which you can then use to buy drinks from the same bartender that just did the whole transaction. WHY???? 

2) The location kinda blows. It's in a weird strip mall across from another strip mall. Have you ever driven by there in the day time? It's shady then, imagine at night time.

3) too hipster. I feel like I am not allowed there as I work for the man, do not wear black leggings, or have razor cut bangs. I, in my mall clothing and ""mainstream"" style, stick out like a sore thumb.

The produce section is perfection. Not mounds and mounds of produce you know is wrinkling and rotting more than Bea Arthur in season 6 of the Golden Girls. Cute little baskets hold just enough fruit and veggies to select from and not too much where you know it's all riddled with germs and spiddle. The meats and cheeses? Oh, my!

This time I had the shrimp curry, which had lots of fresh vegetables, and instead of a heavy cream curry, it was a much healthier broth curry.  We had the edamame dumplings again, which were as good as I remembered.  It was kind of cool to see Dr. Weil eating there last night.

"This place was just okay.  While I can't claim to be an expert in Korean food, I am used to the Korean bbq restaurants in Los Angeles and I can say that this place cannot compete with those restaurants.  

First, they didn't seem to have the proper ventilation for Korean BBQ.  I have never been to a place where you could see smoke throughout the restaurant from people cooking at their table.  Second, the service was AWFUL.  It took them forever to just greet us and bring us water and the fact that it was toooo HOT in there did not make us happy to wait 15 minutes for our water or for someone to even acknowledge our presence.  

The food was decent but the seafood pancake was super disappointing.  They didn't even chop up the green onions that they put in it (seriously, like entire stalks of green onion) and it had no seasoning...  I may give this place another shot but as for now, I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could.",high
"I always have customer service problems with Fedex.  How the heck did they get to be so big with the crappy way they treat customers?  I use the Internet a lot for purchases and about 60% of the time, they screwed-up and then their customer service has major difficulty fixing the problems.  I have asked for shipments to be held at the closet shipping location to my office and they ship to my home.  Another time I asked for the same thing and they held it at the regional depot instead of where I asked that it be sent.  I can go on and on about the screw-ups I have experienced with Fedex.  

But this time they really pissed me off.  I get a harassing phone calls from a collection agency that says they have been contracted by Fedex to collect an overdue bill from me in the amount of $4000+.  I have asked them for details and all I get is harassment.  So I asked Fedex for help and customer service told me to contact Fedex Revenue Services, which I did.  I told them that I am getting harassing phone calls from XYZ collection agency and the person who keeps calling is named Chris.  I also tell them that the alleged amount owed is $4000+ and the account is supposedly in my name.  So I ask that they investigate and tell me if I indeed have an overdue account in my name for this amount.  (I know I do not have such an account!).  Fedex then tells me that they cannot help me because I have not provided enough information.  WTF?  How much more information can I provide?  Do they want my height and weight?  Maybe my blood type?  Maybe I have to provide the names and birth dates of my children too?

This is why I say that Fedex really blows!",low
"This is my first time using Groupon. It's one way to enjoy various cultural experiences without investing too much money just in case. Obviously the restaurant can well benefit from the exposure without costing them too much. It's $20 voucher that I've paid $10 ahead. The restaurant only got $5 I believe. And I did Yelp! extensively before hitting the BUY button.

I understand that it's hard to find authentic foods in USA. Everything is Americanized for one reason or the other. Most Americans I know (not those that I don't know) can't handle strange taste, texture, weirdness, repulsion, and various dislikes. And I know that it's hard to get the same fresh or processed ingredients and spices from home countries.

Those are my pet peeves alright. And there is one more before I get onto the review. Comparison can be deadly.

I have tried Latin American foods (including Yucatan, Oaxaca, Belizean). So my knowledge is nil on Venezuelan foods. But I do have taste buds and experiences from various food cultures.

Overall. It sucked. I was referring to the taste, variety, and uniqueness. It didn't worth my dime. My friend and I had the Media Bandeja (1/2 the regular portion) for $25. The big plates came with 2 big serving of steamed white rice, 2 small cups of black beans sprinkled with cheese, half an ordinary avacado, 2 fried eggs (Chinese style, I cooked that all the time), 2 plain arepas (round flat breads), one chorizo sausage, one blood sausage, 2 scopes of shredded beef, one small steak, few green plantains, and few sweet plantains.

The blood sausage tasted like burned tired. I had blood pudding much tastier and smoother and more colorful that that. I grew up with blood pudding. Yummy!!! That maybe the reason that I'm vicious now. Heed my warning, it's not good for cholesterol.

The steak had tasty flavor; it's ordinary though. I believe it's 5 oz shrunk to 3 oz. The shredded beef reminds me of sloppy Joe. It's OK for the taste. The sweet plantains are regular fried plantains as found in some Chinese buffets or regular dessert menu. It's good for the sweetness but nothing more than that in this restaurant.

If you give me a steam bun or silver thread roll (both are steamed rice dough), I can tell how much salt it contains, the chewing satisfaction, the freshness, and the steamed distinct aroma. And I can eat it plain. Arepas? What's that? It's an tasteless, odorless, chewy carb that didn't excite my taste buds a bit. Boring!!! Honestly, I had no clue how special it was supposed to be. It tasted better after I stuffed avocado and shredded beef inside.

The green plantains were like hard cardboard. Fried carb without taste, but it has a green tinted color.

My friend also ordered Tequenos (fried breaded cheese sticks)... really tiny for $1 each. Chinese egg rolls ($1 each) are twice as big and they are greaser and tastier. (I ain't a size queen).

The Empanada Ham Queso was so tiny with 2-bite size for $4. Come on... are you kidding me!!! Calzones are more complicated and much bigger with ham and cheese and more ingredients, for similar price. (Again, I ain't a size queen).

My point is that it's so ordinary that I couldn't see the cost value especially for Bandeja. I can serve up the same plates at home with minimal cost. I know the restaurant needs to earn money for cooking, serving, paying wages, and renting the space.

We were the only table that night. The wait service was ordinary... between a bus boy and minimalist. The ambient was plain... and not a place you expect to pay $40 for two (before Groupon).

So diners, I enjoy a chance to have a different cultural experience. You should give it a try. Due to a lack of familiarity, the foods tasted bland and boring. I don't feel like gaining any new knowledge except a few words on the foods. I feel like they were serving home cooked meals or peasant foods as ambrosia and they charged accordingly. That's my problem with this restaurant. And I have a totally different experience than the Yelpers here.",high

"I've been eating at Hap's since they were in a trailer in a parking lot on 24th and Jefferson. And for those of you who have don't hail from the south, you will find this to be extremely good BBQ. I always opt for the 2 meat combo dinner with smoked lamb and pulled pork (sometimes beef brisket). Served up with cornbread and mashers plus BBQ sauce and mint sauce on the side. My one gripe is they don't serve corn on the cob. Head over just before or after the busy lunch hour and escape the wait in line. 

I don't see Honey Bear's getting New Times Best of Phoenix consecutive years in a row. Not to say that Honey Bear's isn't good but I guess it depends on what kind of BBQ sauce you like since the sauce makes it.

"Tried this place through Groupon.

Don't have a palette or interest in wine types, so I can't talk about the wine quality. I had all their sweet wines and liked them.

The cheese plate had four of them, I wouldn't say they were uniquely different from one another. There was sage derby, brie, mahon and something else. One of the crackers that came with the plate was very hearty and nice, the other was horrible - like oily tortilla chips that weren't fully fried. The plate also came with cranberries, apricots, grapes, olives and salted nuts and seemed like a good value. 

Overall though I had a good time, and thought the combination of wines and cheeses I had was good. The decor was typical AZ type, brown and beige. They had live music. We sat at the tasting bar but there were groups at tables too. Outdoor seating was available too. Saturday evening was full but not overcrowded.

The person who attended on us was very nice - Christine I believe her name was. Another guy who talked to us first thing when we sat down asked and classified us as Groupon or non-Groupon, which felt weird but I guess that reflects how many Groupon customers they had had. He also said ""you are not drinking to make me happy, you're drinking to make you happy"" when we asked him if he had recommendations which I thought was weird at best.",high

"ZERO stars!
I traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX). I have a couple complaints;
One, I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL. One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn't believe that!
On another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me ""a very inhumane person"" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).
Between the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.
I have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline!",low
"Given the high ratio of staff to customers, it took longer than expected to get acknowledged. However, my drink came out quickly, as did my food. The menu items all had cheesy names based on the Fox sportscasters, but that, along with the 24 TV's playing (you guessed it) sports, made it rather entertaining. The food quality was surprisingly good for an airport sports bar--burger was tasty, bacon was crispy but not burnt, and made with actual sharp cheddar cheese. 

Service was good too. Lorraine refilled my drink the instant it was empty, cleared the dishes and offered the check within a minute of pushing them away, and brought the receipt almost immediately. If I'd been rushing to catch a flight, I think I""d have been fine. Burger, fries, and unlimited Coke, plus tax and tip for just under $17; not too bad for an airport.

Everything was HUUGE.  Coffee and water were always filled. My biscuits were soft and fluffy, and the sausage gravy was delicious! Jeff loved his eggs maximilian, which was gigantic. The eggs, tortilla, hash browns, salsa, chorizo, sour cream mixed together wonderfully. My cousin's eggs, toast, and cottage cheese were fine, very standard.

It's the only thing I've ever ordered there
And it alone warrants 5 stars.",high
"This GB is one of our favorite places to stop for snack and good seasonal beer.  We try for Sundays to do our shopping in the area and stop here....because it is Happy Hour in the bar area all day long.  Great specials on their beers, wine and appetizers.  We have tried several of their appetizers, but you can't beat their garlic fries here!! YUM-O!
Anyhow, the service here is always great.  The hostess, bartenders and waitress are always friendly and ready to take your order.  It is especially nice when the weather is beautiful then they open up the patio/bar area.  Great place to watch games...plenty of TV's.  I frequent the Mill Ave. location, because I work in the area and it does not compare to the San Tan GB.",high
"the promise of homemade turkey and roast beef drew me in, much to my dismay it's shredded. As Ramsey would say 'like a dog's dinner!'. I got the bobby with roast beef, so i could taste both. The bread was good, the stuffing was cold. The meat was chokingly dry. Dry dry. Sawdust tasting. I'm sure the other non shredded meats are great on that bread, this might as well had just been the stuffing and cranberries on the bread. Plus, the manager was bragging about how he just stands around and does nothing but micro manage. Donkeys! Lol. Make that guy clean the bathrooms!",low
Like earning cheaper gas,low
I didn't try any food hear but this place seems like it has a split personality. Tons of tvs showing sports so sports bar. At the same time there's a dj blasting club music. There weren't that many people dancing. We went here because the place next door had a huge line. One plus is that theres a second bar near the patio that we stuck by. This place to me was...meh.,low
"Make sure to explain to your friends that it's not a chili place.  

Every time I invite someone to check this out they assume its some greasy spoon that serves cowboy beans.  It's actually a upscale semi-formal restaurant and......the food is delicious and intelligent.

I've been here for all three meals.  The brunch is good but the dinner is what really sings.

If you like mushrooms, get off here and get your tail to Cowboy Ciao.  The Mushroom Pan Fry has something like 10 or 11 different types of mushrooms.  I'm not the biggest mushroom fanatic but even I thought it was awesome.

If you've ever read one of my reviews you know I'm all about a good burger.  The Wagyu burger here is freaking phenomenal.  Challah bread AND a truffle aoli AND some amazing bacon..........MY GOD!

Definitely recommended!",low
"Family business bagel shops are my favorite.  I found this place through Groupon and decided to check it out.  The name itself intrigued me as Lox means salmon fillet that is cured.  I didn't go with salmon, but I got a honey wheat bagel with veggie lite cream cheese.  The cream cheese was freshly made with carrots, garlic, and celery.  It had a light taste to go with a healthy and hearty sized bagel.  My friends got croissants with cheese which tasted delicious as well.  The prices are very reasonable here and you can order bagels by the dozen.",low
Food was really good. Waitstaff were all really friendly and helpful in selecting drinks and entree. Would for sure go back.,high
"I'm really not the type to want to go out for breakfast, I'd rather save my dining money for lunch or dinner because I figure I can usually make just as good of a breakfast at home.  However, there is no way I could match their french toast, it is just outstanding.  We have been twice and I ordered that both times.  The first time, I told the waitress to put the berry sauce on the side because I usually don't like fruit toppings, they are too sweet and fake tasting.   But this sauce is delicious! It is homemade and very natural tasting, I ate every bit of it.  We also loved the jalepeno bacon.  My kids loved the pigs in a blanket.  We had very nice service both times, we will definitely be back!",high
"Yes, I've had better.

The chai lattes are pretty good, but not worth $4.50 for a large(which was a grande cup size at starbucks).  Prices are just the same as Starbucks, if not more.  And they have a credit card surcharge for less than $5 spent.  I still don't agree with that at any place I go too.  I liked the local artwork displayed.  But not impressed.  If the prices were lower, then I could see coming here more often.",high
"One of the things I love about my neighborhood is that Cornish Pasty is w/in walking distance.

Every pasty Ive had here is awesome. My personal faves include the shepherds pie, the chicken pot pie, and the thanksgiving pasty.

Yes its tiny and loud, but it adds to the charm. Also, the smell that you smell right when you walk in the door= heaven.

We eat in and get to go. Tip for to go: have a beer or a cider w/ your wait.",high
"The staff is really helpful.  I arrived without credit card due to a travel mishap and they were great about providing assistance to get me to a bank to help clear things up.  Their bell staff is friendly and knowledgable.  They can and will get you anywhere in town.  

Room was okay.  Clean, well furnished and updated.  I had a window overlooking the courtyard and I would recommend avoiding that.  It can get a little loud at night.  

Banquet food was good.  Not great, but good and plentiful.  Good variety of dishes for everyone from salads and sandwiches to hot dishes.  A few of the items were a little salty for my taste but with a buffet style service, if something didn't suit, you could replace it with something else.  The break service was astonishing--they really go all out!  

If you are visiting during the right weather, do not miss the pool area.  It's fantastic!",high
"Was here awhile back and Sharon H's review will sum it for atmosphere but i will try and cover my feelings on the taste.

The bruchetta is great.

Yeah really that simple. I haven't tried much but bruchetta here but haven't really been disappointed either. Even the ones that ""haven't been a fan of"" of the ones i tried when i have mixed and matched when getting to select I still would order over bruchetta at most places as they are still very good. Did try a pizza once and wasn't amazed but nothing stood out (it's been awhile since that). The bruchetta however comes to mind every time i hear the word.

Oh and the service is very friendly and attentive. One night I was in and they had just finished a major catering event and it had said on the front door that the kitchen was going to be slow until about the time we arrived. Yet when we ordered and it took a bit to get the food (barely a delay in my book and if I hadn't been apologized to by the waiter probably wouldn't have know it was longer than normal) we got a nice little discount.",high
"This store is too busy. Don't get me wrong, I love my Mac more than anything but the service at this store is god-awful. Luckily before purchasing my Mac I researched until I knew exactly what I wanted. I seemed to know more than the associate that helped me! Purchasing it was more of an awkward affair - I couldn't wait to get out of there. 

Also, it's always almost impossible to get into the Genius Bar. My iPod malfunctioned sometime earlier this year and after waiting in the store for 45 minutes to be seen, I was only informed that the damages were more in depth than they thought and I would need to schedule an appointment. It's just an iPod, people! The experience itself was more than frustrating. I stick with Amazon on this one.",high
"Best calamari in town, and awesome service. Tokyo glow is a great drink, super refreshing.",high
"We have one of the 1st ones to open in the valley right near us and it's OK.  Sure it has a selection of ready to eat or grocery selections, but watch the pricing.. you (somewhat understandably) pay for the convience and the ""time savings"" of their ready to go's.  I do like their concept and do shop there occasionally (more like if i just need something quick).

Their hotdog buns are sorta sweet which is different, not different bad, just different!

As for the Hybrid only parking... I don't think so...  what a joke!  :)",high
"I've never been so impressed with the quality of food here, but it's fine for a chain American-Italian restaurant. But I am currently sitting here at a table, and have been for an hour, with no promise that a plate of food will be here in the near future. I'm not sure I will be back, I'm sure the Keg next door is better, and that's not saying all that much",high
"I can't remember the name of the special salad we had tonight with Shrimp, but I will never forget the taste.  FABULOUS is an understatement!  The NY pizza was equally as great.  Every time I come here I say to myself, we need to come more often.  Everything is always good.

Diane was our server tonight.  What a cutie!  More important is that the service was excellent!  Diane was back at our table many times checking to see if there was anything else she could do for us.  Another comment I want to make is there was a young man taking care of the table.  At some point I thanked him and was surprised to receive ""Your more than welcome"", instead of the typical ""No Problem"" statement coming from young people.  I should have gone to the management to tell them I was impressed by him, his smile and mannerisms.

We will be back!",high
Really fast and friendly service even during busier moments. The staff is also very helpful when asked to assist with using copiers and finding appropriate mailing supplies.,high
The Tavern on Mill is an average sports bar with cheap drinks and we come here to watch UFC fights because they don't charge a cover. We always leave when the fights end because there are better nightlife options in the area.,high
I would rather go to Benihana to be honest. I have been here a few times because its so convenient but has never been worth it in the end. I have eaten here and had dinner to go it always takes forever and it is not cheap I expect cheaper if theres no atmosphere or really good food would make up for it. I have not gotten sick from the sushi here but lets just say I didnt feel so hot after eating here the last time. I looooove sushi and its hard to say that I wont be back here but I'd rather drive a bit farther and skip running the risk.,high
"Well the view is obvious.  I mean - it is decently high up and gives you a good view of downtown but, I don't know - the view from the Arizona Club is better.  

We went here after watching a show at the Herberger and I was expecting some high class expensive dining that that is exactly what I got.  The service matched the price tag which was nice to see but the restaurant itself was disappointing.  Not only did they not have Coke or dark rum but they let poor Ashley A order a prime rib and then told her they were all out.  

I had the drunken shrimp and they were pretty excellent.  The sauce around them was really good and they were resting on a piece of toast disguised as a crostini.  I also had a few bites of the lava cake but since it was buried under a pound of powered sugar, I couldn't eat any more.

I guess I just agree with Beth S's review...I'm just not seeing what justifies the price.  The District in the Sheraton next door is a restaurant in a hotel that has amazing food that is priced better than this.  Plus, the view there isn't half bad.",low
"Definitely a place where the reputation precedes the actual experience.

It's like it's trying to be Binkley's, and it's not even in the same ballpark.

We were there on a THU night, and the place was dead.  Still, it seemed to take 30 minutes between courses.  Which is fine, if you have some bread or amuse bouche between.  Which you don't at Posh.  So, you eat your tasting portion in 4 minutes, then you sit there for another 26.  By the time the 3rd course came of our 5th course meal at hour one and a half, we were all tired, bored, and no longer hungry.  We ended up asking our last course to be wrapped, as we were that turned off.

What really disturbed me on the food, however, was the foie gras.  An extra $15 supplement - which is fine, as I think it's always worth it for great foie gras.  We were presented a plate with nice size piece of foie gras, in a fruit coulis, and what looked like a nice brulee crust on one side.  It looked amazing.  And was, if I stopped at eye appeal.  Unfortunately, Chef decided to go way off the grid, and serve it COLD.  I'm not talking room temp, I'm talking refrigerator cold.  If you are a foie gras fan, then you know this is like eating a square of lard.  It was impalitable.  Imagine being served a lump of shortening on a plate, because this is what cold foie gras tastes like.  

I like the surprise aspect of the courses, and I like the fact you can tell them what you like and don't like to start, but ultimately, I see now why it's best to know exactly what you're getting in advance.  

It took me about 10 minutes to figure out why the whole concept of Posh fails.  The dining experience starts when you're wowed by a menu, and sit in anticipation of what you've ordered.  When you have no expectations, it's hard to get excited.  By the time the plate is dropped and the server is telling you how your fluke is in a mascerated lima bean sauce with a marigold flower garnish and buttermilk glaze, you're not really into the ingredients, and just want to eat.  I had to ask my server to repeat every course I was served at least twice - lol.

Perhaps if I hadn't been spoiled by Binkley's, that has an expansive menu that changes daily, and you pick from 4-7 courses BUT you are given about 6-8 amuse bouche (and bread which is served French style with choices) between courses, I suppose I would have been more impressed with Posh.  But not by much...",low
"This is the best buffet in Az. HUGE variety from veggie dishes, fish, shrimp, mussels, and even sushi. The quality of food is very good too. One thing I have learned is when looking for good Asian food, look inside! This place is always full of beautiful asian folks so you know its good. Just sayin'. For a buffett, they have a really nice staff. There is a shrimp dish with a sweet cream sauce that is amazing. It is more pricey than most asian buffets but well worth the extra few bucks. I eat here at least once every couple weeks.",high
"Unlike other airports I've been in where your options for food are your massive conglomerate chain restaurants like McDonald's and Burger King, Sky Harbor has a nice array of more local, higher quality restaurants for you to choose from (e.g., La Grande Orange, Olive and Ivy, Barrio Cafe), as well as some healthier choices compared to eating a greasy burger and fries (e.g., Paradise Bakery).  There are a lot of good parking options, whether you choose the airport's own parking lot or private lots that provide shuttle service.  I also appreciate the free wi-fi, it definitely helps whittle the time away while you are waiting for your flight!",high
"I love this arena...maybe I am biased since I am a diehard Suns fan and a downtown resident, but it really is a nice facility.  The Suns games are always well put together...great announcer, great dancers, great entertainment, and great concessions.

I attended the last game of the season in a suite Wednesday night and was impressed with the space and the food...actually quite good!",high
"While I don't like to hype places up (because really, how GOOD can any one place be) ...How good can one burger joint be over another, or how good can pizza be over another pizza place (when weighing the ones that are all generally Good in the Public Opinion).  Now the word around town is that The Grind is Sofa_King Great.  I will say about The Grind that when you're up for a Burger, this place hits the spot.  I've been here once before August 2010 (don't remember what burger I had but recall it was good) and the other night I had the Peppercorn Burger and it was as good as it gets.  I was starving and really hadn't eaten all day and that helped add to how much this hit the spot, but make no mistake, it was really good and I do enjoy this place for the atmosphere, service, and quality of food.  My friends wife got one of those healthy wraps and she liked it a lot.  The sweet potato fries (we ordered the half sweet potato and half regular fries) and they were good.

As for some other areas to review: The atmosphere is nice.  It's casual and not too dark and not too light inside.  (That's how I like it).  There's multiple flat panel TV's above the bar, so plenty of games on at any given time (That's also how I like it).  The service is fine (although based on some other reviews people have been so so satisfied about the service.  That's often going to be the case with most casual establishments - so sometimes it's good, and sometimes not to our satisfaction).  Such is Life!  Anyway, back on track here, the Wait staff and Bar staff have been worth the 20% tip both times.  No complaints by me about this place, however I do see some 2 and 3 star ratings on here.  

Where I will dock 1 star and sort of agree with Kristi D.  She mentioned the large photo of Sheriff Joe Arpaio on the wall (while I sense that Kristi doesn't care for Sheriff Joe, I'm neutral about him), but I agree about all the oversized photos of notable names in town who have dined in The Grind.  I'd much rather see real artwork or real photographs on the wall - and not photos of Sheriff Joe, Mark Grace (for those who don't know, he's a former baseball player), and the Mayor of Paradise Valley, all holding their burgers.  Who the hell cares about any of them and their burgers.  I think I'd be more ok with having these photos above me, but they are HUGE enlargements and a bit overkill.  And they are for sale and the proceeds go to some cause.  Look, I'm all for causes and shit, but I wouldn't spend my money on a 36 inch enlargement of these local ""notables"" holding a burger.  The whole concept is pretty stupid.  But hey, I'm generally uptight and been doing photography 20+ years and probly am just hating on the fact that my photos are hanging on the wall.
 
Side Note:  For those who might have previously had ""Liked"" The Grind on Facebook but no longer have their page as a Like, it's because they apparently had their group page hacked, so they had to start over.  I found this out when I Liked it the other day noticed there were only about 165 Like's, and certainly I knew this place was way more popular than that.  When I commented that, they commented back about it being hacked and starting the page over.

Fantastic venue! The bartenders are nice- the drinks are excellent. The lounge is an amazing place to hang out (best downtown spot?!) even if you aren't going to the show! Cool free shows in the lounge! Now let's talk about the main reason you would go there- THE MUSIC! And the venue itself is awesome! The sound is great! The ROOM IS GREAT! It was designed by someone who knew what concert goers want- an intimate experience with fantastic sound. And so if you have the curse of ALWAYS standing behind the TALLEST DUDES EVER at shows- you can now take advantage of the bleacher seating in the back of the room or benches on the side. THERE IS NOT A BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE! What is left to say ? GET THERE!,high
"What a fantastic experience!  

If there is a high-end food product that you don't find at whole foods, then you may find yourself to be one of the pickiest eaters known to man.  This place offers everything under the sun.  For the love of God they have almost 30 different types of olives!

My family is new to shopping here and we like to splurge a little bit.  For some reason it's comforting to know that there are 4 different kinds of ribeye and what seems to be almost 100 different types of cheeses.  I guess realizing that makes me think that there won't be anything forgotten at Whole Foods.  Unlike Sam's Club, Whole Foods gives samples that actually taste delicious and almost make you grab for seconds when instead you just grab an actual wrapped portion of the product (darn, had to buy some sometime).

On a 'grocery store' level, this Whole Foods gets 5 stars that's for sure.  The only reason it gets knocked a star is because some Whole Foods locations offer more services to make their guests feel like it is supposed to be much more than your typical grocery store.  This is a location where I think the patrons would be willing to use everything that they had to offer if given the choice.",high
"OK guys (and gals too), I know size isn't everything, but OMG, this place has crazy size portions and I loooove it!  We ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms (1/2 orders) and STILL, the servings were huge.  Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer.  They were great and tasty, but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that?  The calamari was decent, could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce, but for those who don't like a lot of fan fare with their food, this would be perfect; classic calamari with classic sauce.  We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim, just how I like them.  For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni ""D"".  Both of them were absolutely fantastic...yumm.  And both were HUGE.  The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in, very smart.  For those with little ones, the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere.  Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well.  Their chicken fingers are home made (the pickiest of adults would eat these things!), no french fries; home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets.  This is the KIDS menu!  Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell, but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding.  Great leather booths, linen napkins, white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth, elegant, but not stuffy.  Guys could go in with t-shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up, you can as well with out feeling overly so.

I am definitely going here again, what a find!",high
"(aka. SKETCHY TEMPE with BONNIE G, Part One of Three)

I was in Tempe. I was having coffee. I was sedate. I wanted to see if anyone wanted join me and discuss Kafka or something boring. And so I called up the town's most famous resident to see what was goin' down.

""Um, YOU need to see sketchy Tempe. It is time. And I will be the one who will show it to you. Meet me at Time Out Lounge. No, wait. Meet me at Monkey Pants. Yes, Monkey Pants!""

And so I did. 

Monkey Pants! Sorry folks, but this name is nonsensically awesome. I walked in and sat myself at the round bar, joining a smattering of other patrons sitting there by themselves, each staring into nowhere in particular. Well drinks for $2.50, served in a standard kitchen glass. Nice! I proceeded to watch the football game and was soon joined by my Tempe tour guide.

We were approached by the bartender to do discounted Patron shots....but only if we wore sombreros. There was barely anyone here on a Sunday night, and I'm of the kind who doesn't care anyway, and the thought of me and Bonnie G sitting at a desolate stripmall bar with sombreros on is kind of ridiculous and great at the same time, but shots were not on my agenda for the night. Alas.

I then got a royal tour of the place, including the great leg lamp (actually it's two legs, not just one!), shuffleboard, pool tables, couches with a cozy fire being played on endless loop on a big screen TV, ample board games and another section with tables and chairs, which is where we sat, under the painting of the teddy bear in Richard Simmons gear. 

Other patrons were seated all over the large space, so everyone had their own private area in a way. I actually really dug this. I'm not one who needs a place to be crowded to enjoy myself or feel like ""it's happening."" Sitting around a fake fire with pints and board games with a few friends is more my speed these days anyway. So I may sound decrepit, but I'm really not that old. I swear.

Sure, Monkey Pants has frat-party gimmicks throughout the day, but this place has no pretense whatsoever. How can you even take it seriously? Even it doesn't take itself seriously. 

I mean, it's just sitting there. In a strip mall. In Tempe. With a painting of a teddy bear wearing Richard Simmons workout gear on the wall and a stack of sombreros sitting next to a popcorn machine. Waiting for you to leave your critical mind behind and enjoy the now.

And enjoy the now we did. 

All thanks to my Sketchy Tempe tour guide.

4 stars.

"I truly wanted to love this place! I had the shrimp/pork spring rolls and shrimp/chicken vermicelli salad - both were quite good, with the exception of the rice paper and noodles tasting like they were rehydrated with unfiltered tap water (both had a weird taste). My husband's food, on the other hand, was terrible! He ordered #44 - the rice was extremely dry and chewy, the pork chop tasted ok, but was mostly bone and gristle, and the shredded pork was downright disgusting.",high
"Scary things to me:
Paris Hilton has a career. 
Sarah Palin. Really. She's like the new Anita Bryant. 
My fathers' overgrown eyebrows. Trim, daddy, trim!
Droves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe. 

Seriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, ""Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?"" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me. 

Finally. I found it. And entered. 

Cute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here.
I had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however. 

I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it! 

I will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off.

"I've been boycotting this store since 2009.  One afternoon after browsing for a while with my kids, I allowed my 10yo and 8yo to stay in the children's section to pick out a book to spend their allowance money on while I ran next door to TJ Maxx to buy the toddler a pair of shoes.  I'd been gone 30 minutes when I returned to find the horrid lady in the children's section had called the police on us.  She never asked the kids  their ages and didn't ask if they had a way to reach me (they did).  The police talked to them, realized they were perfectly well behaved consumers, and assured me I'd done nothing illegal.  Avoid like the plague.",low
"Don't know why it took me this long to check out Joe's Farm Grill but my out-of-towners got a kick of this place.

Sweet Potato Fries - 2*
Garlic Fries - 4*

- open kitchen / sauce bar
- friendly staff 
- outdoor picnic benches under a huge tree where the kiddies can enjoy themselves
- hand washing fountain conveniently located by the soda fountain

The bad:  
- lots of flies outside (that's summer in a farm for you)
- limited seating inside
- real vanilla milkshake tasted weird ( too much lemon juice?)",low
"This is my favorite fine dining in town.  I only go here 2 or 3 times a year because it's a little pricey for dinner, but wow, what great food!  Dessert is awesome here too, love the Sundae.  I just went here for my birthday last week and it still lives up to expectations although they don't carry my favorite anymore (double cut grilled pork chop).  They might start carrying it after they move to their new location though, here's hoping!

"This is a real find and I mean ""find""  because it is tucked away on the side streets of downtown Glendale. This small little restaurant is unique in decor and cuisine, not many polish restaurants around.  The food is flavorful and fresh, the soups are unique and tasty.  The stuffed bell peppers are awesome as is the stew.The owners are warm and inviting without being overbearing.  

My only disappointment is the limited hours, I work too far away to get there for lunch and they are only open a few nights a week.  Definitely worth the trip.",high

I don't get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.,low
"I would never have stopped at the Wy-Knot Cafe if it had not been for a friend mentioning it in a post on Facebook. I am glad I saw that post. There have been a number of restaurants in that location that have failed. Wy-Knot has opened the space up, made it dog friendly (it is named for their dog) and has a great menu. You order at the counter and then they bring the food out to you. The employees were all very friendly. The only down side was the lack of parking due to the other businesses sharing a lot. Also there were hardly any customers. Hopefully they will deliver menus to the houses in the neighborhood and maybe do some promotions on the neighborhood e-mail service so people will know what they have to offer. I would like to see them make it.

They serve breakfast and lunch all day. They had a variety of choices and it was hard to decide on one. We split a BLT and a Chicken Salad Sandwich so we could try both. They come with a side of beet salad or salad of the day. The beet salad was very good. We both preferred the BLT but I am sure the Chicken Salad was more healthy and it was tasty as well.

Give them a try, I think you will enjoy the Wy-Knot Cafe. I will be back.",high
"Another visit: 

Greeeeeeat carne asada tacos, torta and that orange cake! Quesadillas, pork and chicken, were a great balance of cheese, meat and sauce.

That orange cake though?! Like, I am one of those people that would do ...things for good carrot cake, and the basic format of carrot cake done with oranges, cream cheese icing and all, was a wonderful flavor surprise. 

Gallo Blanco looks like a top contender for Places to Take Visitors. Just a very well rounded place to give visitors a taste of good eats in Phoenix and examples of well done and delish Mexican cuisine.",high
"Well, i was very excited to go to this event, however, not so excited when it was all over. The music was great and it is a very nice place. It really reminds me of Vegas. However, it  was fashion week and we all thought that we would see models sashaying down the runway. But, no. No fashion at all. The wine was comp and it was very good ,i give great praise for that!  But the samples of food were few and far between. The Servers skipped out many times. Not like most Yelp events which are usually out the door GREAT!  We ordered from the happy hour menu.  I fully agree lots of salt, but i think it was the soy sauce, it was the most salty..i have ever had. There is very little parking here as well so be prepared for that as well.  All in all we had a good time.But, not as fabulous as most Yelp events.",high
My favorite place in the world to eat! Great service and awesome food!,high
"Not much to write here. I always park on the Sears (upper level) side when I visit Chandler mall. My last visit to the mall, I ended up buying a luggage set on sale at Sears. The cashier was helpful and even checked to see if all four pieces were present (I didn't even think to, LOL). Four stars. No negative feedback to report.",high
"I eat here at least once every week since it's close to my office, and they are always quick, tasty and reasonably priced.   I usually get one of the lunch specials (even the Chinese-sounding dishes have a Thai flair, especially if you order them with extra spice), but if you're hungry the house special chicken is well worth the extra buck, as are the Thai noodle dishes (the pad see ew is my favorite).  

The wait staff is always friendly, the food is always quick, good and reasonably priced.  i haven't had a bad experience in several dozen visits, and i'll continue to call myself a regular.",high
"The line was ridiculous.  The price is kind of steep for what it is.  The dog is kind of messy because of the way it's made.  But you know what?  I enjoyed it in a way I haven't enjoyed a hot dog in years!  Wow, that sounds kind of dirty.  This really is a unique take on one of the most common American foods.

I passed through the sea of trucks and people that is Food Truck Fridays on a mission to finally try the much yelped about Short Leash Dogs.  I can't say much too much that hasn't already been said.  While the 20 minute wait wasn't too thrilling, it all paid off in the end.  I just went with a traditional wiener, with tomatoes, onion, relish and spicy mustard.  While I was intrigued to try some of Short Leash Dog's specialties, most of the dogs on today's menu contained an item or two that I don't really like, and I wanted to compare Short Leash Dogs to what I am accustomed to the first time around.  Good sausage, good toppings and the flat bread is fantastic. 

I would happily join Lindsey F. by tying my leash to the cart and following them around town.  And I didn't even know that I still enjoyed hot dogs that much without a beer and a game!",high
"The Chuck Box is dark. Very dark. Even in the day time it feels like night in that place. This doesn't help when it comes time to put condiments on one's burger. I am skeptical as to how well the condiment bar looks in good light, which may explain the choice of lighting. Still, grinning and bearing it, I load up my veggie burger with appropriate toppings and, usually with fried zucchini in hand make my way to one of the very uncomfortable seats.

Every time I go to the Chuck Box I feel as if there is going to be something wrong with the food, and this something is being concealed from me by the lack of lighting. Yet, each time I go I have a delicious veggie burger or grilled chicken sandwich. My friends have also enjoyed ""real"" burgers there as well. 

Maybe it's best they keep the lights dim, but the food tastes so good there may be nothing to fear after all.",high
"I've been a Char's patron since before we were legal to be in there (many years ago, previous owners). It has always been a lively place with a diverse crowd of aging black hep-cats, college students, bikers, tweakers, college students, heavy middle aged white women who love black men, the ocassional tranny and Hispanic couples on dates with a sprinkling of occasional stippers/hookers. In other words - everything you would want to make a blues bar entertaining and just seedy enough to be interesting. 

They are one of the only places in Central Phoenix with live music almost every night of the week and the cover, if any, is typically only a couple of bucks. The place is small and dark and crowded, like a blues bar in an old converted house should be. Talent varies by night but anytime you go it's passable. Personal favorites are lady J and Bam Bam and any combination thereof, which is what you usually get any way. Wander in on a random Monday night and 11:30 and you will find music, cruising, and drinks waiting. There is a small enclosed patio up front for smoking, about 16 spaces in their lot and street parking available on the residential street, but watch the signs and don't block driveways. You can also cross 7th Ave, but be careful dodging cars. The neighborhood looks scarier than it is so don't be alarmed by a transient or two wandering down the street but they don't bite unless you pay extra. Close to lite rail as well in case sneaker pimps want to try to cross over from Central, but hopefully they won't.",low
"I always connect here because I fly US Airways from Las Vegas.  But everytime I have a stop over here, other than a major back track to the Bay Area, I don't really mind coming here because it's a well maintained airport. It might look old but it is always clean. 

I'm only here about 1 or 2 hours at a time but I can't help but notice all these restaurants in here, if you're hungry and don't mind 'airport prices', never fear selection is here.  

Also be prepared to walk close to a mile to your connecting flight.  There's LONG hallways here. Don't worry, they have standing walking escalators.",low
"Really solid lunch deals and pretty close to Tex-Mex which I still get cravings for from time to time. I had the spinach chicken enchiladas and they were nice. It was a ton of food (of course) so we definitely needed boxes for leftovers. If you're in the neighborhood, it's a solid deal and I'd stop in again. My only wish is that they did a green sauce with the spinach chicken enchiladas. That would be heaven.",low
"I've only ever been here for Transylvania which is their Friday night Gothic Industrial night.  It's acceptable.  I have high standards.  Sometimes the music is really good.  Sometimes it sucks.  They have 2 DJs and I can always tell when the switch from the one whose tastes I enjoy to the one whose tastes I don't.  If you're looking for Death Bunnis, Razor Grrls, Baby Bats or *sigh* Suicide Girls, you'll find a few of them here.  There are a lot of regulars and I usually have a good time, unless of course I don't.  The people there have all been fairly nice.

The drinks are nothing special.  They aren't terrible, they just aren't terribly consistent.  If you need to get wasted, get some shots poured. At least that way you know what you're getting.

So when you need to strap on your boots, wear your eyeliner, and shake your ass, give it a shot.",high

"Agree with everyone on here, this is some really good food.  Very laid back un-asuming place inside another strip mall on Bell Road.  Ah what treasures lie hidden in a strip mall....

We were greeted by a friendly young man who took our order right away, I ordered, well I don't quite remember the name,  but it was steak pieces with french fries and onions, and rice.  I was fooled by the mild salsa that came with the chips and said, ""hey can you make my dish spicy?""  The server said no problem, and while the dish was very fresh, my mouth was on fire, and I touched  my eye and it was like pepper spray or something.  I love hot food, I can eat Los Dos Molinos Abogado ribs for example with little problem, but this stuff kicked my butt!!  It had little red peppers in it that I have never experienced before. HOT!!  I kept remembering Deb's review:""....this is not Mexican food...."".  No kidding, next time I will get it milder.  My eye burns still.....

Wife got a milder flat pan steak dish with lentils and rice.  She praised its freshness.  We also split a red beef tamale (they were only like $2) so it was just a sample but decent.

They only have 6 tables in there!  And they had to change their name due to copyright infringement from a restaurant  in Texas according to the young man.  Either way, we will be back for sure.  Good stuff!!  Something tells me there is more burn to come, perhaps tomorrow if you know what I mean?  Beware!  They can really spice it up if you ask them too.  I met my match at Mi Comida....

Fresh ingredients, nice people, and a nice change from Mexican food.

Recommended!  Don't touch your eyes if you touched those little red pepper things, that is for sure!!",high
"Stop the presses and buy a lotto ticket, I'm actually giving a place on Mill more than 2 stars!

The bf and I came here around 10 on a Friday night and were FINALLY *pleasantly* surprised with the place.  We've been to several places along mill trying out the area since we moved here and have been met with nothing but sloppy people (both young and old), watered down drinks, and mediocre service.

+ no cover, nice doormen/bouncers (though there's a $5 cover after certain times on Fri/Sat. for guys, ladies free)
+ responsive and knowledgeable bartenders.  I ordered the tequila drink (ha, who woulda thunk) with grapefruit and it was *delicious*.  If you don't want a sugary kick in the face with your alcohol, try this drink!  The bartender was funny when I ordered it and said ""oh honey, it's not very sweet, is that okay?  Some people don't like it""--thank you for making sure.  My bf ordered some 10/12 year anejo double shot (can't remember) and really like it....hell, I even sipped it and didn't reactionary gag!  Let's just say sauza and jose kicked my ASS freshman year undergrad-- I'm forever ruined
+ wide variety of drinks and tequila...that may seem like an obvious thing at a tequila bar, but I've been to a few that were pretty skimpy.
+ decor and vibe was on POINT.  Somehow the younger crowd here doesn't act like one drink is sending them to blackout town...score.  Somehow the cougar-looking women here don't flip their hair every time a younger guy walked passed them...score.  Somehow the older people were grooving to the music more than the young bucks...score.
- minus one star for no AC...is that normal on Mill? no AC? and if so, WTF IT'S HOT AS BALLS, TURN THAT SHIT ON!

Like my (ex)governator said ""I'll be back"".  Seriously, I'm excited to have found a place that didn't make me regret driving to Mill, woohoo!",high

"Sitting at the counter at FnB is an experience that should be had, period. Our reservations by default was later on in the evening, but also turned out to be quite fortuitous. Not only were we able to see chefs Badman and Curry in action, but also saw them turn down the kitchen towards the end of the night. It is a display that even the most advent epicurean is not often exposed to. There are no doors or walls to hide behind. Everything that you eventually place in your mouth is out in the open and also in the way it is prepared - from the raw, to the stove, to the plate. 

Impressive was also how fluid the kitchen moved with only the two chefs preparing dishes. Chef Curry preparing the appetizers, fish and fowl; while Chef Badman shoveled coal onto a grill and simultaneously manning it to ensure rib-eyes were cooked to order. 

The ambiance was the type you'd expect when invited into another's kitchen, and the food tasted as if given the same attention. So to the service. Our waitress, Chantelle was nice about explaining everything to us after hearing that it was our first time there. When she found out we had moved just a few months ago, she was kind enough to write down her restaurant recommendations for us too. 

Will definitely be back to try other items off their ever-evolving menu. Reservation for two please. Yes its okay if its at the counter and yes, its fine if its late.",high

"My husband and I visited the olive mill this morning. We decided to go there after finding reviews on here so Thankyou! It is kind of funny also since we live in Circle Cross Ranch which is just right up the road from QCOM. I have passed this building so many times and just tossed it up to another little local farm out here. First we sampled all the olives and the different oils and dipping sauces. My husband complained he thinks the products are overpriced but I thought they were reasonable since they are really good and don't taste anything like the stuff you get in the supermarkets. After selecting a few items, I bought the mesquite almond stuffed olives and lemon and blood orange olive oils. Blood orange is amazing I can't wait to try it on a salad. I also bought a plain virgin olive oil.The oil is so flavorful and their claim is it is pesticide free since they don't have a problem with some sort of fruit fly they normally have problems with in olives here because of our dry hot climate. We decided to grab a bite. This was the only problem, not for me but for my husband. I guess this is a perfect place for the girls to get together for lunch but if you have a man that has a pretty hearty appetite like mine then he may not quite be satisfied with what he receives.It was perfect for me. I ordered a paninni that had roasted squash, peppers, arugula, fennel garlic aoli and a parmesan balsamic sauce on it. It was very good. Came with a side of kettle style potato chips and some olives. He had a salad but truthfully it was not a very big salad especially with the salads that could serve 3 you mostly see these days. I guess it is true Americans have come to expect quantity.That is ok, I would definitely go back. I will just have to make sure I leave him at home next time and go with one of my gals instead",high

The food was surprisingly really good and the service was excellent.",low
"Having lived in Mesa and delivered sub sandwiches to some of the tweekiest of tweakers, I don't feel any shame in admitting that whole area now resides in a dead zone for me. When I get that itch to go out and tear up the town, waste away a lazy afternoon, or enjoy a nice dinner, I think of places north, south and west of Tempe. It's like my brain has one of those little electric dog collar things attached to it, and when I start to stray too far east, it gives me a subliminal zap so I erase Mesa from the map in my mind.

So naturally, Stray Cats is usually a place I visit when meeting up with others who have suggested it. 

Thing is, I always end up having a pretty good time when I go there. The drinks are priced reasonably and generally on the strong side, the bartenders are friendly and quick to serve. The music is pretty good, but I've never been here when a DJ's spinning. I used to like the fact that there was an air conditioned smoking room off to the side with plush couches and big televisions. The crowd is always diverse, friendly and easy to engage in slurred conversation.

It just doesn't have any special oomph for me. I'd much rather frequent Hollywood Alley a couple miles south, where there's pool and live music. Unfortunately it's also on the black list of Mesa, so maybe I should find a way to reverse that programming. It's not just tweakers and mormans, it's not just tweakers and mormons, it's not just tweakers and mormons....",low
"If you've never had or even heard of bingsoo you NEED to check this place out. I have two friends who were constantly bantering about bingsoo and this Fresco place. I was excited when I found out it was so close to my house. If you've never heard of it, this is how it goes down. It's a layer of shaved ice, then you have your choice of ice cream or FF frozen yogurt, your choice of fresh fruit off the menu (apples, strawberry, mango, banana kiwi and many others) and then your choice of ""sauce"" which is a fruit puree of either strawberry, kiwi or mango and honey. You mix it all together and there you have it. A somewhat healthy dessert! They even have a frequent bingsoo buyers card =)

"Despite being a red-blooded American male, I find this place a bit below average.  Yes, the waitress wander around in shorts that would make a cheerleader blush--but rail thin bottle blondes don't do anything for me or the food itself.  

I've eaten here twice: the first time, I ordered huevos rancheros and coffee; today, I had the protein pancakes.  In both cases, the service was mixed and the food was bland.  My food came out quickly both times, but my server disappeared each time as well.  Today, I sat for 15 minutes until I was able to get the attention of a manger who located my server for me. 

The food itself is not bad, but nothing to cheer about.  The protein pancakes were enormous and dense, but not nearly as flavorful as one expects from an item filled with almonds, blueberries, and cinnamon.  As others have noted, they'll ding you on side orders--sour cream, tomatoes, guacamole, and the like will all cost you a pretty penny for diner-quality stuff.

Finally, it doesn't affect the food, but the decor is garish and plain.  Remember that first apartment you got after college with the white walls and tan carpet?  This is basically the US Egg aesthetic.",high

"I've practiced yoga for years at At One Yoga and initially wasn't happy about their merger with LifePower. But now, after several months of going to LifePower, I think it's pretty nice. 

The facility is big and clean and very well kept. If you want to use the entire facility (the weights and machines) you have to sign up for a monthly contract. However, if you just want to take the yoga classes, you can buy them packages of ten classes. The ten classes can be used over any length of time. I like that because if I'm out of town or busy, my class package doesn't expire. I do wish they offered more class packages, like in groups of 25 or 50 classes, the the way At One Yoga used to do. Because typically the more classes you buy, the bigger the discount. 

The great majority of the yoga instructors from At One Yoga have come over to teach at LifePower. I've taken yoga classes in several places throughout the US and I think these yoga teachers are among the best in the country.",high
"Tried this place for weekday lunch.  We arrived before noon and good thing since they have a big lunch crowd.  (not to worry, plenty of parking in back and seating outside w/ misters)  Kudos to Aric and Monica for stopping by our table several times to make sure service was great or they fixed it.  We started with the Bruchetta, which was piled high.  The we had the Smokey (arugula & smoked prosciutto) and the Marg pizzas. Almost had the Pabst on tap, but went for the Dunkel since its harder to find.  As if the food wasn't enough, the decor and ambiance was over the top.  The herb garden as you walk in and the bar with the salon chairs was a nice touch.

The Bobbie, which is made of freshly roasted turkey (I've seen the big hunks that didn't get chopped), cranberry sauce, stuffing and a hint of mayo is fabulous!
The capastrami is a delightful combination of hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and cole slaw, and wonderful in taste.
You can choose the size of sandwich you want, as well!
Capriotti's also has salads, and a host of other sandwhich selections, which are consistently delicious and fresh.

We stopped in to try the new soft serve ice cream with sprinkles that turn the ice cream a new color. Don't know if the boy behind the counter was stingy or what, but the kids got only a couple of sprinkles that didn't even cover the ice cream which was disappointing considering they charge for them. All in all wouldn't visit this location again. We prefer the one closer to home :)",high
"I've only been to the bar here. They make amazing mojitos with an array of different fruits. I told the bartender to surprise me when I ordered my drink, and it was amazing. She put a mixture of fruit along with the mint and it was perfectly mixed. I also had their spicy shrimp appetizer which I didn't really care for. So many other places make a similar dish, but much better. They also serve really good rolls with butter that come out nice and warm. The texture of the rolls are a little unexpected. I think they use tapioca flour as their base. I will definitely be back to enjoy their main dining cuisine.",high

"This is a tough one.  It's probably the best Filipino restaurant in the Phoenix area.  But that's not saying much, because the few there are here are really not good.  Compare Jeepney Bistro to one of the places in Filipino Town (Los Angeles), and they get blown away.

And, for the record, my wife is a Filipina.  And she cooks MUCH better than the chef here.  No contest.  A lot less grease/fat/oil, that's for sure!!

Also, their portions are a bit small.  Bigger than a few other places I could name, but still small.

If you really want some Filipino food, and you don't know my wife to beg some from her, this is probably your best option without driving to LA.  But don't form your opinion of Filipino food based on this place.  Go to LA and try Bahay Kubo Natin, or some others, and you'll get a much better idea of what the cuisine is about!",low

"After reading the other reviews, I thought perhaps I would weigh in - they seem to be all over the place.  The critics are correct that the decor seems dated.  To me, having grown up back east with this very sort of restaurant, it was charming.  The restaurant is particularly enjoyable to visit at night, when they turn on the lights in the garden.  

I enjoy the layout of the dining room, although I agree it is a 'cooler' experience to eat in the bar.  I guess some people could be offended that the staff sit down and eat in the bar when it is slow, but I'm not one of those people - I think it adds to the charm.  

I had a very late lunch yesterday - around 3 - thanks to an appointment that went on forever.  So we ended up heading to Riazzi's for a late dinner, around 8:30.  At that time of the evening, the dining room was closed., so we sat in the bar.

Their service is truly one of the strengths of this restaurant.  On this night, they were unusually attentive - even for them. The waters came out immediately upon sitting down, then they took your drink order - as it should be. Neither my iced tea or water ever got below half a glass.  This is something I occasionally find annoying at places where the staff draws a lot of attention to itself when they refill drinks - particularly when it interrupts the flow of conversation.  Not at Riazzi's - they are attentive but unobstrusive.  

Their bread is my favorite restaurant bread in the Valley - hands down. It is actually better than the Italian bread I grew up eating back east in Hartford, New York, Boston and Providence.  It's so good that I wish they had loaves available.  You have to possess a lot of discipline not to fill up on the bread.

The salad is as others have described it - traditional, but fresh.  

My favorite item on the menu is now listed under pizzas and described as a Spinach Pie.  This used to be listed under appetizers as the Grass Pie, but if you order a Grass Pie, they'll still know what you mean.  It is a cheeseless pizza with spinach and arrabiata sauce.  Confession:  I love all things arrabiata. But this combination here is perfect.  For about 1.50 (I can't recall the exact figure), they'll add mozzarella to it, but I've never done that because it is perfect as it.  

They bring you a healthy amount of tasty parmesan cheese, so you can always throw that on the Spinach Pie.

So, I had that. Outstanding as usual. My wife ordered the Penne Primavera, which was very good.  Last time I was there with my daughter, she had the penne with garlic and oil, which I thought was just superb.  Simple, but perfect for a garlic fan like me.  I have a feeling most folks skip over such an entree in favor of something more elaborate, but I recommend it.  

We didn't have an appetizer, and even though I wouldn't describe the portions as enormous, they were generous and neither of us could finish our entrees.

Is Riazzi's going to be sexy for the young, hip crowd?  Probably not, although it is romantic at night with their lights and sunken/elevated dining room, and has the 'cool' factor of the bar.  It totally hit my 'nostalgic for the east-coast Italian restaurant' needs.  

I just wish the service at most modestly-priced Valley eateries approached Riazzi's. You can get spoiled with the bread and service over here.",high
"I brought DD and her friend here today after a long day of Summer Camp and running around.  

We showed up shortly before 3 p.m. for their Pop In Playtime, which is supposed to be from 10 am to 5 pm.  

There are two rooms of bouncy house contraptions that are appropriate for children older than age 3.  I don't know if they have actual age or size restrictions, but kids younger (and/or small kids) would have a difficult time here.  One reason it would be hard for younger kids?  There are specific instructions for the contraptions which they go over with the kids before they are allowed inside.  Some have a max of 2 kids at a time (the obstacle courses), some have a max of 6.  One has a max of four, with three on the ladder and one going down the slide.  Younger kids would likely need to be constantly reminded of the rules, as they can be a little rigid.

Both my 4 year old and the 9 year old LOVED it here.  They both said they preferred it to Jumpstreet.  

The girls were bummed out when at ten minutes to 4 someone came in and said playtime would be ending in ten minutes.  Then the guy said if parents wanted to know why, we could approach him.  Upon approaching him, he said that two birthday parties were booked for 4 p.m., so they were ending Pop In Playtime early.  

Some parents were VERY upset, having just gotten there less than 30 minutes prior.  DD was very disappointed.  It took a little prodding to get her to put her shoes back on and get ready to leave after only an hour of playing.  

On the way out, some parents stopped by and talked to the shift manager.  She just handed out cards for another session since ours was cut short.  Pretty cool; we will use the cards to bring another neighborhood kid back with us.

There were JUST the right amount of kids here at this time of the day.  I cannot imagine how nuts it must be here on a weekend or during Summer mornings.  

Still, bring a book and some bottled water and sit on the sidelines... or do as I did and run the obstacle course several times on the insistence of the kids.  ;)  It was fun!",high

We were in Phoenix for a quick weekend and I had neglected to do any Yelp research before leaving, so when my bf found M&S from the concierge we decided to give it a go.  We had been disappointed with our last experience at the one in Dallas so I was mainly just hoping to have my hunger satiated so I could go to bed.

I was very pleasantly surprised.  We were hungry so ordered what felt like tons of food (don't judge!).  The mussels and bruschetta to start were great!  The mussels were small, the way I like them, and the sauce/broth/bread soak they were in was amazing.  I had the halibut stuffed with a bunch of stuff as suggested by our server, bf had the dover sole, both were good, but that dover sole was amazing!!!!  very light and perfectly cooked.  I wish I could cook fish like that.

We finished with some kind of passionfruit mousse dessert that was SO good.  I almost took another one to go.

The service was great.  I would go back to this M&S location anytime I was in town.",high
"When I moved away, these were the tacos that I missed! 

I stopped back today, and must say - it was exactly how I remembered!  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced at $5.99 and come with two items and rice and beans. I always get the hard taco - seasoned shredded beef, lettuce, and cheese in a deep fried corn tortilla - and the cheese enchilada. I could eat the rice and beans alone, both are so well seasoned and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese! The only thing to watch is that the red hot sauce can vary from visit to visit - some days it's super hot, others - not so much.

The wait staff is exceptionally friendly and always try to help me because my Spanish is so limited. The interior is large but very modest, there aren't a lot of fancy decorations - this is a place to come for the food and service and  not th ambiance. 

Still, one of my faves!",high
"AWFUL.  Not sure it classifies as food.  Burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat.  No salsa, beans, cheese, sour cream, guacamole.  Nada.  Plus they won't let you add anything to it.  Everything is as is.  The cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted.  The food was barely luke warm.   Service is also mediocre.  The salsa was gross.  It was super water down.  The best part of the meal was my Pepsi.",low
"This place is fast becoming a favorite happy hour stop for my fiance and I. Service is friendly, the panini's are delish and the bruschetta is to die for. Anything with their yummy fig jam is amazing. I love the ambiance. Very casual, trendy and lively with great outdoor and indoor seating. I'd say service is on the slow side, but it's understandable b/c the place is always packed. They have  pretty good happy hour deals. I will say that the parking situation kind of sucks (valet only unless you want to park down the street). But other then that, I have no complaints and will definitely be back!",low
"Fancy  shop with great kitchen items that I would use for our kitchen. 
It seems whenever I go in there their products don't work. 
Avoid ordering any of their coffee pots because we had to return them twice in a row. It seems like whenever we walk in there the employees don't seem to be knowledgeable about the products there. 
I give this store three stars for having a variety of kitchen items and an enchanting place to visit.",low
"I agree with Chris L.; I was disappointed with the cafe.  Granted, I was looking for a college-type coffeehouse where I could grade papers, and this place just didn't have that sort of lounge-y feel that even certain Starbuck$$ have.  There was no background music being played, and even with my ipod/headphones on, I was distracted by nearby conversations.  I got much more work done at 3 Roots near campus.",low
"I love Saddle Ranch for its casual night time festivities (including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe), but I cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting!

When I think of my meal this past Friday night, I think of two words: dry and cold. The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy. The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's, maybe even worse. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon. Really? It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless. There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere. I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and, though I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer tower looks pretty badass.

For me, I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere, but I will definitely be staying away from the grub. Adios, cowboy.",low
"Love it, love it, love it! I have been eating at various Pita Jungles around the Valley since I moved to AZ over 6 years ago and I have yet to have anything that I didn't love. My favorites include the Black Bean Burger, Lentil Fetoosh Salad, all three hummus types, dolmas, and gazpacho, but everything is delicious, so you really can't go wrong! The Tempe location also has breakfast, which is amazing! 

Each location is fairly small, so luch and dinner may require a short wait, but its worth it. The prices are fair and the portions are huge! Don't be afraid to split a dish with a loved one.",high
"Cork is an enigma.

What makes it enigmatic is how damn good it is... Too good for Chandler and maybe too good for the valley.

The portions are just right, and anybody that tells you otherwise is a fat ass or a glutton (I'm 6'3, 200lbs. and I was satisfied).  If you want large portions though, go to their lunch/brunches.  I've been there twice and had The Lamb Chop, which was amazing on all levels, and I've had some serious lamb in rural Bosnia, which has been labeled the best in their country... sure enough cork's stood up blow for blow.  The other entrée I experienced was the buttermilk fried chicken.  I was so amazed by the lamb the first time, that I had to try something more ""simple"" in order to qualify their food in regards to regular places.  Let's just say the chicken was not regular, it was outstanding.  The appetizers are crazy good... can anyone say king crab legs?

The wine selection is top notch.  the booze selection is killin, and they even make this amazing Italian lemon stuff that's like 90% alcohol.  make sure you have a designated driver, because this place will inspire winos and boozers to indulge to their fullest.

Go to Cork, because it's that damn good!",high
"Went to Yogurt Kingdom for the first time tonight.  It was perfect.  Lots of flavors to choose from.  My favorite is the Tart Vanilla.  But I got a large cup and tasted at least 8 different flavors and I enjoyed each and everyone.  I wanted to go back and get some more of the Tart Vanilla but my husband gave me one of those looks when I suggested it.  You can either eat inside or outside.  The place is decorated so cute.   There was a very cute and well mannered girl to greet us and told us how it all worked just in case we had not been there before.   They offered to give us any samples that we might like to try.  There was a gentleman there who turned out to be the owner.  He was very kind, friendly person  and glad that we stopped in.   The bathroom was very clean and the entire place was tidy and well maintained.   We will be back very soon.  I would recommend this place to others that like yogurt.  You won't be disappointed.",high
"I find it hilarious that someone would reference this place as being terrible,  compare it to (overpriced and bland) Humble Pie, and in the same breath say it was the best chili relleno you ever tasted.

 I can't vouch for the chicken tacos but most street tacos are nowhere near packed with meat. By definition they are usually very tiny with onions,some guacamole, a little cabbage, and some small cuts of meat.  I can say the tilapia tacos are tops(large filet on each) on the list of my girlfriend's quest for good fish tacos. I can say the pork nachos are the best I have had as the pork reminds me of Los Dos Molinos in a small way. The empanadas are excellent as well.

If you go for happy hour you can get two empanadas for 6 bucks. You can also get 2 large fish tacos for 6 bucks. Would you like some awesome tortilla soup? 4 bucks.
If you get the dinner version of the emapanadas with a large portion of some of the best rice and a side of black beans I think it sets you back about 11 bucks. I have also had the chili relleno and it is the best I have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything, why the venom?

I learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first. When I asked they said the chili relleno, pork, empanadas, and red sangrias. Guess how my dining experience went? Try ordering tacos from Los Dos Molinos and you will leave pissed. Order the green chili pork and you will drive 100 miles for it.

I do hope you give it another chance I have honestly never had anything sub par here in my 7 or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do.  I agree that Main Ingredient is great also, that's why I took the time to write about it. 

But to reiterate:

11-13 dollar for most dinner items besides new york strip(on the list to try), is not pricey

happy hour has most items for 4-6$

street tacos are not bursting with meat

ask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want.

Humble Pie  was more pricey and not worth it, All it does is take up parking from a much better place next door. For a place with the reference to pizza in it's name you would think it would be better, it tasted like peter piper.

I would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion, I cant think of any besides maybe the California tacos at the now closed Chuy's, but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotle/ranch like sauce which is similar.",high
"*cut to scene* Friday night, lounging around discussing the lameness of the evening, ready to indulge in a new adventure. six pack of Newcastle sits untouched in fridge and bellys aching for fulfillment. yelp.com search reveals a local japanese eatery nearby. 

enter, Hana.

first off, pre-game excitement for this BYOB, local, fresh sushi spot. Newcastle in hand, my friend and I strutted in here at around 8pm on a mildly warm Friday night. the place is jammed, and a couple parties stand around waiting for tables. great, a long wait. nope, two seats open at the bar. sat down, and our beer was immediately taken and put in a fridge to ensure it wouldn't lose any of it's remarkably smooth quality.  first beer is poured, and the excitement ensues. friendly and welcoming server devluges us in the specials, and unfortunately they were out of most of their fish as they have been for three weeks. toro and salmon were our options, so we went with a special for the night, the spider roll, and the vegas roll. also, edamame to start.

the food was superb. the edamame came spicy with a side of chili flakes and siracha for our never ending quest to burn the shit out of our mouths. a second round of newcastle was brought upon when our first was finished, and the sushi came shortly thereafter, looking like little pieces of art. both sets of rolls were enormous and came about 6 to a plate. the vegas roll was packed with cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. the special roll, the spider roll, was full of crispy soft shell crab and just enough spicy-ness for a much needed kick in the mouth. one dip in my wasabi/soy sauce concoction was more than enough.

our third and final beer was poured by an overly-anxious and over-stimulated, presumably newbie, bus boy. I had about 4 inches of head on my beer and my friend got hers spilled and nearly twice as much head.  he excellent waitress we had made up for this guys slips during the meal. the staff wished us a nice farewell on our way out, and I felt as though I had just left a very close friend's house. 

I will definitely be back with more six packs and good friends to share this little diamond in the rough with.",high
"In a hurry in the Phoenix airport and saw Blue Burrito Grille. Ordered the Big Blue Burrito with pork. Unlike a previous reviewer, I got a LARGE burrito with plenty of fillings including some very tasty pork. The salsa was also very good. Their website says that the burritos come with chips and there was a huge bin of them on the counter but alas my burrito came sans chips... which I didn't notice until after I was on the airplane. A good place for a quick Mexican lunch but make sure you get the chips.",high
"Yay, even though I miss living in Coronado I am glad to be back at the Melrose America's.  If you have read any of my reviews you know how disappointed I was with Coronado America's rude service that I boycotted that particular location.  

Now that I am back around Melrose I can once again enjoy Happy Hour Tacos and drinks, or their delicious breakfast burro and cochata.  If 7th St let you down try 7th Ave.",high
"The food is delicious.  The service:  discriminatory.  The bartender, blonde gentlemen, went around to everyone else, then finally acknowledge us.  This is embarrassing, I don't know what else to say.",low
"My nephew just moved to Scottsdale recently so me and a bunch of friends brought him here to show him a local bar that he and the girlfriend could come shoot pool, watch football, play volleyball etc...well....we weren't there 5minutes and 2 kids were running around the pool tables, messing up our games and screaming. I couldn't believe the staff was allowing this to happen. They were hitting the pool sticks on everything and crying when their mom attempted (in vain) to quiet them. You'd think the mom would leave at this point with her  kids....um...no....the staff did seem annoyed as well but said nothing. Then....it happened...she said "" you guys better behave or mommy will be fired""!! Holy shit....she works there!! Even worse! Shame on that owner for allowing this to happen. And that employee needs to recognize this...YOU WORK AT A BAR.....not a daycare....A BAR!!!",high
